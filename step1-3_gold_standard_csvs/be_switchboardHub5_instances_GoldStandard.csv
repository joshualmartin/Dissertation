sw_4520,9,A,181.14,192.82,11.68,well i think n- the problem with that the problem i had because when i went into teaching i decided that i was just gonna be you know the perfect creative teacher and ,1,0

sw_4577,7,A,60.45,68.54,8.09, right and i- my goal is to just really learn how to be a good teacher because uh there's not it's not that easy ,1,0
sw_4577,23,A,174.41,180.72,6.31,no i- right now i'm at a junior college but i'll be transfering to Stephen F Austin State University,1,0
sw_4580,2,A,14.04,21.71,7.67,and there's really not even a Soviet Union any more i mean it's disintegrated it so sort of a silly question to be asking um,1,0
sw_4580,14,A,73.39,85.27,11.88,right  i mean there's no doubt that because the weapons are there  that  we worry about the  you know if they could be sold on black markets to countries like Libya or  if um,1,0
sw_4580,41,A,240.2,247.84,7.64,the mayb- the bigger fear may be  those weapons falling into the hands of somebody we don't want them to p- you know we  we trusted  ,1,0
sw_4580,86,B,179.65,185.05,5.4, which seems to be happening i guess more freedom to- to travel over there and to- for them to come over here ,1,0
sw_4580,94,B,218.7,224.31,5.61,the- both sides having the weapons  is a deterrent supposed to be an aterr- deterrent itself ,1,0
sw_4601,14,A,96.71,103.41,6.7, there shouldn't be any problem i think you'll find that we can use up the five minutes about like the blink of an eye,1,0
sw_4601,26,A,224.43,238.82,14.39,uh  unfortunately my backpacking experience has not been as good  recently be- mainly because uh the type of camping i've been doing has been with the boyscouts  and boyscout backpacking is a far cry ,1,0
sw_4601,28,A,240.4,251.52,11.12, yeah uh actually last summer i had a chance to just take uh uh about one group of six and one group of seven  out on a single overnight and it turned out to be,1,0
sw_4604,53,B,26.5,33,6.5,uh over the entire United States i think even including Alaska where you might expect the cost to be higher,1,0
sw_4604,54,B,34.05,39.84,5.79, and i'm not exactly sure  what that can be attributed to i think it's a l- lot of it is uh,1,0
sw_4604,69,B,143.48,153.33,9.85,right the quality of education i think is is reasonably good i just think we're paying too much for it  my wife happens to be a uh  a learning disabilities consultant,1,0
sw_4604,73,B,175.47,188.84,13.37,we're really getting our money's worth for for helping these students i think they have to be helped in some way but i'm i'm  i'm just wondering whether the process is really efficient and that's just one of the kinds of uh  services that we're really paying for,1,0
sw_4604,80,B,264.98,279.28,14.3,sort of have inertia too they they accept what's given to them too by their experts their administrators and just pass it on  i don't think anyone's really gone into depth to try to uh see just what can be done to make it more efficient ,1,0
sw_4683,18,A,78.89,86.97,8.08, you know i try not to be too um into clothing and into makeup and things like that  um and i've gotten a lot better but uh,1,0
sw_4683,19,A,86.97,92.36,5.39,it's stuff the since i might be going into the peace corps i- i'm not even buying clothes  but uh,1,0
sw_4683,41,A,184.09,185.91,1.82, having to be real ,1,0
sw_4683,76,B,120.96,124.33,3.37,so then i'll be wearing more of- business style clothing ,1,0
sw_4686,80,B,223.37,231.22,7.85, it wouldn't yeah it wouldn't do any good to for it to be an amount like where i work now it- you can get that independently you can get that kind of insurance ,1,0
sw_4689,10,A,55.68,60.17,4.49, s- my time with them is not what i'd like it to be actually i get to spend  ,1,0
sw_4694,7,A,21.37,30.19,8.82,but um i've got a- a girlfriend whose grandfather has already made all kinds of arrangements if he needs some sort of long term care he'll be able to get it ,1,0
sw_4694,19,A,88.23,96.14,7.91,i know here in Raleigh recently  in Wake County around Raleigh um there was one nursing home that th- was going to be closed ,1,0
sw_4694,30,A,144.07,151.59,7.52, i think that would be one of the best things you could do and and i don't know one thing with me is i just try to r- rely on my gut reaction,1,0
sw_4694,37,A,176.47,188.23,11.76, and hopefully there'll be somebody to take care of us you know where we won't have to go into a home but  my my dad says that what h- there's five of us kids and he says that he's gonna spend two months of the year with each of us ,1,0
sw_4694,81,B,104.68,115.74,11.06,yeah it does because if  you just think if your own family don't want to be bothered with you what about someone else course they getting paid of course,1,0
sw_4694,102,B,217.49,225.36,7.87, is a plus because if it was me i f-  if i ever got to to that shape or got to that age i just felt i'd be a bother to people ,1,0
sw_4776,19,A,128.08,136.85,8.77, and it's supposed to be really good but  i don't know i like something that's cheap and that's relaxing as well as good for you,1,0
sw_4776,70,B,136,144.32,8.32, yeah walking fits that i mean i figure when i go back to uh getting some aerobic exercise it'll probably be walking instead of running ,1,0
sw_4776,85,B,223.57,230.33,6.76, that may that may be me too i uh  the only one i ever really enjoyed was uh frisbee golf,1,0
sw_4776,86,B,230.33,244.13,13.8,you know that's you know and and i got to be pretty good with a roommate of mine in college he was competitive but he toned it down when we were going out and playing  and so it was more of a challenge to myself you know a golfer is mainly trying to get your score down,1,0
sw_4824,34,A,200.02,207.24,7.22,and yeah i- i'm sort of in the same positioning it would be nice we'd now have a Nissan ,1,0
sw_4824,38,A,223.99,233.05,9.06, might be useful on a on a somewhat smaller scale  uh it wouldn't overcome a couple of thousand dollars worth of difference in price for the same features though,1,0
sw_4854,11,A,46.37,50.6,4.23, i'll be have to be  somebody have to be ,3,0
sw_4854,39,A,214.31,222.98,8.67,it's still a bit cold up here yeah i wouldn't it wouldn't be it's not you wouldn't freeze to death but you'd need lots of blankets to keep warm the way it is right now,1,0
sw_4854,61,B,43.98,47.57,3.59,uh i guess they're a lot easier now than they used to be,1,0
sw_4854,75,B,118.35,126.04,7.69,yeah yeah my husband's be- he- he's been in Miami and now he's in Hou- i'm here in Dallas getting ready to go down to Houston and he's in Houston right now  ,1,0
sw_4854,80,B,146.98,161.25,14.27,a lot of places like we- we lived in Oklahoma for a while we- that's where i we're from actually Oklahoma  and if you went to a lake it was busy i mean so busy you know you couldn't hardly ski because the water'd be all chopped up because there was so many boats on the water and  s- ju-  but here,1,0
sw_4910,3,A,6.73,12.76,6.03,i mean yeah i think you know uh it'd be nice especially like you know when people are kids are going to college they should do some public service,1,0
sw_4910,36,A,182.22,191.2,8.98, i don't know i i think it- a lot of it's just you know see how other people live i mean you know i  i tend to be you know in in my own circles of friends and ,1,0
sw_4910,58,B,24.05,28.41,4.36,i think you just about have to be away from home for a full year,1,0
sw_4910,59,B,28.41,36.53,8.12,under less than ideal conditions   to learn some of the uh a- u- you know lessons that really need to be learned ,1,0
sw_4910,61,B,39.12,50.03,10.91,twenty six you're young enough so you might have been affected right  so yeah i really i really feel that um if every kid had to be away from home,1,0
sw_4910,69,B,77.98,81.17,3.19, but um yeah i th- i think it would be wonderful,1,0
sw_4910,88,B,175.31,178.7,3.39, what what sort of things might you feel would be uh ,1,0
sw_4910,94,B,209.09,214.94,5.85, well i- i personally feel that six weeks of basic training ought to be the- a mandatory part of this year,1,0
sw2001A-ms98-a,13,A,56.957,65.593625,8.636625,right right and does it does it change i guess um you can can you judge like  depending on what you think you'll be doing that day,1,0
sw2001A-ms98-a,23,A,105.06875,112.05175,6.983,uh other times it could be very casual if you knew you would be at a desk  day and nobody would see you  um,2,0
sw2001A-ms98-a,30,A,162.04225,176.97825,14.936, that's true so um do they were were there um are you allowed to um be casual like if it was summer were were you allowed to wear sandals and those tha-  not reall-,1,0
sw2001B-ms98-a,49,B,213.4715,225.878375,12.406875,y- yeah but there's really no written rule i guess they couldn't write that down that might be discrimination or something i don't  i mean i've never been told what to wear or what not to wear,1,0
sw2005A-ms98-a,13,A,97.97125,112.2395,14.26825,um-hum yeah probably the hardest thing in in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in nursing home and um she had used a walker for for quite sometime probably about six to nine months and um,1,0
sw2005A-ms98-a,38,A,307.412625,312.840875,5.42825,um i- i- i think it would be it was more of a relief for her,1,0
sw2005A-ms98-a,56,A,408.49225,417.43075,8.9385,you know that that it may be one of the solutions to a lot of things e- e- even child care you know i mean of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not,1,0
sw2005A-ms98-a,57,A,417.43075,426.95075,9.52,any of the grandparents          they're gonna be a good caretaker for our children but i mean they raised us after all,1,0
sw2005A-ms98-a,62,A,454.48475,463.98475,9.5,money seems to be too big of an issue wi- with with with with with what's going on today and i i think i think that we may not you know that may be,2,0
sw2005B-ms98-a,3,B,21.679,32.549,10.87,i'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out uh our had t- place my mother in a nursing home she had a rather massive stroke about uh,1,0
sw2005B-ms98-a,8,B,56.448,65.94675,9.49875,had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while that was really not a very good experience uh,1,0
sw2005B-ms98-a,9,B,65.94675,71.492875,5.546125,it had to be done in a hurry i mean we didn't have you know like six months to check all of these places out,1,0
sw2005B-ms98-a,14,B,88.273375,100.422125,12.14875,you know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out all the places that uh might be available course there's you know there's not one on every corner especially in you know smaller areas smaller towns,1,0
sw2005B-ms98-a,63,B,250.11325,255.5985,5.48525,and uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should be done,1,0
sw2005B-ms98-a,78,B,321.7255,323.755125,2.029625,um-hum that'd be tough,1,0
sw2006A-ms98-a,8,A,73.063125,82.592875,9.52975,from what i've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up and that we won't be polluting the air i'm sure we have to have,2,0
sw2006A-ms98-a,63,A,400.902625,415.230125,14.3275,yes it's a heck of a lot different i mean w- we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk we were about the only place in you know TI that had the gray metal desk people used to come and laugh and go gee i hadn't seen one of those in ten fifteen  ,1,0
sw2006B-ms98-a,42,B,370.847125,384.842625,13.9955,expenditures because_1 it can get very expensive but i think we you know we do all kinds of things to make the the the world a better place to live and i think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that i really would ,1,0
sw2007A-ms98-a,96,A,413.600125,419.770875,6.17075,yeah um i don't know you know used to be a lot of states had uh,1,0
sw2007B-ms98-a,8,B,39.450875,44.331875,4.881,i wonder when they're gonna what they'll be able to use in pro- in place of Freon,1,0
sw2007B-ms98-a,15,B,77.52025,83.611625,6.091375,be it electrical as in your home refrigerator or propane as the one on the ship that you said,1,0
sw2007B-ms98-a,16,B,83.611625,90.47075,6.859125,uh you had and uh somehow cr- heat must be created that Freon,1,0
sw2007B-ms98-a,29,B,154.115125,160.145625,6.0305,and therefore you won't be able to just pull in anywhere to or you wouldn't even be able to do it yourself at home,2,0
sw2007B-ms98-a,34,B,185.361875,190.504,5.142125,spending summers at my grandfather's place and i'd be running around with nothing but a bathing suit,1,0
sw2007B-ms98-a,83,B,406.632125,412.878875,6.24675,i've often wondered about the LA now that's supposed to be about the worst c- city in the country i guess for,1,0
sw2007B-ms98-a,112,B,554.862375,560.0765,5.214125,uh the induction ports and and etcetera etcetera whatever needed to be changed over,1,0
sw2007B-ms98-a,117,B,583.129,587.422375,4.293375,now could be that we could do the same thing that they're doing out in California,1,0
sw2008A-ms98-a,34,A,142.523375,144.6145,2.091125,oh yeah it'll be comfortable,1,0
sw2008A-ms98-a,42,A,175.259,186.6005,11.3415,i'd like to be able to wear those here today it's eighty eight degrees so  needless to say my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while ,1,0
sw2008B-ms98-a,31,B,136.632875,143.529,6.896125,it's one of those skorts you know the the it's shorts but it looks like a skirt so i think that'll be good for work too,1,0
sw2009A-ms98-a,49,A,250.935,265.64,14.705,and it'd be nice if we had a big ole motor home and that way i could load up the rest of the wives and go to wherever the football game is and have someplace to sleep without spending big money for a hotel and and park it outside of the stadium and have a good ole time,1,0
sw2009B-ms98-a,60,B,271.861125,277.566,5.704875,so it it it it's a it can be really handy to have a camper just,1,0
sw2010A-ms98-a,10,A,29.474125,32.839,3.364875,could be i- i haven't been to South Dakota ,1,0
sw2010A-ms98-a,18,A,51.060125,65.695625,14.6355,that's true i agree with that um i- i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it i think it's been nominated for twelve awards and and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud so it it has surprised everybody,1,0
sw2010A-ms98-a,44,A,183.507,192.89425,9.38725,i think that i think he really his heart was in it but i d- i don't think he really knew it was gonna be as big as it was i think it was something that he really wanted to do,1,0
sw2010B-ms98-a,31,B,178.918625,184.251625,5.333,uh the question is did he did he really know it was gonna be good or did he just do it,1,0
sw2012A-ms98-a,6,A,43.224125,48.247,5.022875,finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh,1,0
sw2012A-ms98-a,13,A,79.75025,83.967875,4.217625,right it turned out to be uh uh an invitation ,1,0
sw2012A-ms98-a,29,A,171.457875,180.1215,8.663625,well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would prefer to not to be known and i mean you know the classic,1,0
sw2012A-ms98-a,59,A,330.49925,341.706875,11.207625,uh you know just like software is only given out to customers i mean you can't believe that  it would it would be pirated and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering,1,0
sw2012A-ms98-a,62,A,357.24575,366.996125,9.750375,and that hacker just has to get into in touch with a sneak thief and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be you know an invasion of your actual home,1,0
sw2012A-ms98-a,87,A,519.39125,532.657875,13.266625,there's hope i actually for all for the time i've spent there i still don't quite understand how certain things that i assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy,1,0
sw2012A-ms98-a,88,A,532.657875,538.311,5.653125,because_1 anyone can be alone for oh some period of time but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that,1,0
sw2012B-ms98-a,4,B,66.66,80.142,13.482,so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that i realized no i i really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so that was almost an example of a si- an invasion that turns out to be not invasive,1,0
sw2012B-ms98-a,13,B,135.973,147.803125,11.830125,and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control and you one's feeling obligated because uh some sense of of the way the ritual is played out,1,0
sw2012B-ms98-a,26,B,252.9775,264.858,11.8805, uh the the other side of that might be uh if if s- there's someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense,1,0
sw2012B-ms98-a,30,B,276.5375,287.278125,10.740625,that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there'd be cou- good possibility that their facts were were fantasy,3,0
sw2012B-ms98-a,31,B,287.278125,301.94175,14.663625,and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from me that i would rather they didn't and that might be the sense of a spending pattern for instance that that i would have thought to be private but then if it turns out to generate,2,0
sw2012B-ms98-a,40,B,366.015625,376.72975,10.714125,and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling threatened as a result of of it so s- maybe that is a a little bit of what privacy is,1,0
sw2012B-ms98-a,46,B,422.499875,426.30475,3.804875,but but no concept for wanting to be private,1,0
sw2012B-ms98-a,50,B,441.638375,444.998875,3.3605,oh th- that would be,1,0
sw2012B-ms98-a,52,B,446.189125,449.26575,3.076625,that'd be culturally ,1,0
sw2012B-ms98-a,67,B,548.638625,561.08875,12.450125,that's interesting are th- are there any other specific things that that you feel like where where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either g- on a growing frequency,1,0
sw2013A-ms98-a,58,A,408.533625,413.635125,5.1015,so it wouldn't be so bad  all right so you think,1,0
sw2013A-ms98-a,61,A,420.59525,429.61175,9.0165,you don't think it would be economically feasible for your family and ours see both of us are teachers and we got four in our family too,1,0
sw2013A-ms98-a,73,A,490.44075,503.65975,13.219,you know socioeconomic areas homes and it's just like they always have money they they always are dressed nice you know most of them_1 are fairly nice not like you would think a a poor person would be,1,0

sw2024B-ms98-a,49,B,301.731125,311.876375,10.14525,but as you say it's it's sometimes it's difficult to to know if it's you know i think if somebody wants to say -kay read these ten books because_1 these are self-improvements i would probably be turned off to them_1,1,0
sw2024B-ms98-a,50,B,311.876375,320.474625,8.59825,he casually just walked into it and uh put down a Stephen King book and uh picked up one of them_1 it might be a little more interesting ,1,0
sw2025A-ms98-a,27,A,132.131375,140.45,8.318625,just shouldn't be allowed to to even even live uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge ,1,0
sw2025A-ms98-a,45,A,299.537125,312.0165,12.479375,yeah yeah i mean you're you're in Dallas so everybody i can't believe they can uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence you'd have to be pretty dense,1,0

sw2025B-ms98-a,21,B,68.780375,83.07875,14.298375,you know it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway on what he's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know what's his whim to decide it should be two months,1,0
sw2025B-ms98-a,26,B,97.83075,110.51275,12.682,well even if it's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for s- children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that,1,0
sw2025B-ms98-a,27,B,110.51275,117.00825,6.4955,so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really,1,0

sw2027A-ms98-a,73,A,503.4775,515.6945,12.217,we've kind of had a variety there but i think a lot of times it's it's mainly who they're going to meet with they're they're meeting with people that they know is gonna be dressed that way then that's how they are if there just gonna be meeting with TIers,2,0
sw2027B-ms98-a,2,B,12.49925,21.829375,9.330125,it's pretty bad but it's true  you know they tend to try to be you know real lax and supposedly the policy is like you know,1,0
sw2027B-ms98-a,8,B,85.77325,93.613,7.83975,and you know if i know that they're gonna be there you know y- you i try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up and if i know they're not,1,0

sw2027B-ms98-a,81,B,522.96125,534.981,12.01975,that's the way to do it i mean that's the smart way to do it it really is because your making you know if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in you know in a six hundred dollar three piece suit,1,0
sw2028A-ms98-a,139,A,592.18625,599.596,7.40975,you know a building explosion or something like we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station,1,0

sw2064B-ms98-a,23,B,98.248625,104.756875,6.50825,somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than than um expecting,1,0
sw2064B-ms98-a,24,B,104.756875,110.867375,6.1105,the feeling that it right with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know,1,0
sw2064B-ms98-a,91,B,360.09775,364.413,4.31525,but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone,1,0
sw2064B-ms98-a,96,B,387.807,392.196375,4.389375,i didn't i hate having to be in charge of someone else's life,1,0
sw2064B-ms98-a,99,B,401.282,403.0525,1.7705,that would be really awful,1,0
sw2065A-ms98-a,6,A,30.0815,36.00325,5.92175,um-hum would uh would you be more in favor of uh you know like a local,1,0
sw2065A-ms98-a,34,A,202.124375,205.5515,3.427125, or it can be,1,0
sw2065A-ms98-a,64,A,337.058125,347.784875,10.72675,if the racial make up of the group was such and such you know they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and you know all this kind of thing,1,0
sw2065A-ms98-a,93,A,491.88325,502.435125,10.551875,and when they came back they'd have to serve this this this year and it turned out to be kind of a joke the ones i knew you know always chose the Red Cross because they didn't do anything,1,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,2,B,7.972625,18.51925,10.546625,i think it would be a great idea i'm not sure about requiring it you know of people because_1 people are going you know feeling resentful i don't know but i think it would be a great idea,2,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,3,B,18.51925,31.2645,12.74525,seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of you know what they want to be or do or you know they could learn  something and maybe help other people at the same time and we sure our country all countries sure need help so,1,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,15,B,67.8265,77.4225,9.596,i think that would be real interesting for people to do but i guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries and,2,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,16,B,77.4225,84.955625,7.533125,but i don't know if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then may- maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to,1,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,26,B,120.144,129.77675,9.63275,but it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a certain age and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex      them and,1,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,35,B,167.986125,176.89875,8.912625,yeah i've heard that like in China and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you  somebody you'd be murdered them you know on the you know street so yeah ,1,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,54,B,262.0025,276.212625,14.210125,things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way i i it would take quite a few people i think it might build jobs for people you know that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that so maybe that part of it would be helpful too,1,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,66,B,311.902875,319.2155,7.312625,yeah really there could be um some uh scandals involved if you know it wasn't people that were really fair and,1,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,68,B,331.876875,333.587625,1.71075,it would be open for,1,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,70,B,345.50125,349.237875,3.736625,yeah that could be a complicated too couldn't it yeah,1,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,78,B,411.18725,418.47975,7.2925,the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show Kisha Knight Pullman was starting a i guess now she's practically a teenager ,1,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,82,B,449.344625,456.92975,7.585125,but they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know so they were trying to start that out so if there's people out there that are,1,0
sw2065B-ms98-a,104,B,537.48025,548.14675,10.6665,and um they're all over the world and its it is an incredible logistics i mean they have a training center where they teach them it's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah and they have to be taught the language and,1,0
sw2067A-ms98-a,8,A,33.454625,36.71225,3.257625,well that's very can be very very true,1,0
sw2067A-ms98-a,12,A,51.742375,60.96375,9.221375,absolutely well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you will be paying interest,1,0
sw2067A-ms98-a,33,A,175.32825,181.984125,6.655875,right well i think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted,1,0
sw2071A-ms98-a,22,A,106.18825,111.73825,5.55,several things about the car it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be,1,0
sw2071A-ms98-a,31,A,166.03625,175.56525,9.529,um a Mercedes Benz they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable,1,0
sw2071A-ms98-a,57,A,293.888125,296.17325,2.285125,they seem to be really durable,1,0
sw2071A-ms98-a,61,A,307.380125,310.408125,3.028,what i would consider to be a  investment,1,0
sw2072B-ms98-a,7,B,56.3595,69.9705,13.611,i used to do that a lot and then i like um  we have a new child that'll be a year old here next week so i'll take a lot of pictures of her you know and spoil them_1 first one you know how that is and um  uh,1,0
sw2073A-ms98-a,20,A,150.860375,157.574375,6.714,i'm always amazed at that that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know,1,0
sw2073A-ms98-a,25,A,196.8665,211.856125,14.989625,you know it's it's women's rights and the a- and that sort of movement and so it's uh quite the opposite so elections start getting very uh the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones,1,0
sw2073B-ms98-a,3,B,3.48,15.619375,12.139375,okay well um let's see i i think uh there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard and,1,0
sw2073B-ms98-a,9,B,46.563,53.206625,6.643625,it'd be really difficult to have that one pers- perfect person that believed exactly what you believed,1,0
sw2073B-ms98-a,18,B,116.51775,126.949375,10.431625,the Democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded,2,0
sw2073B-ms98-a,37,B,215.04875,225.45775,10.409,yeah that's true that the different places in America that uh you know different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place,1,0
sw2073B-ms98-a,80,B,433.705625,439.171125,5.4655,we saw it on the uh the T- News one day and i thought wow that might be interesting ,1,0
sw2078A-ms98-a,40,A,142.385875,146.498625,4.11275,and you're going to be able to buy your what was no wait,1,0
sw2078A-ms98-a,79,A,246.841,249.74,2.899,well but they can't be though they don't have as much money,1,0
sw2078A-ms98-a,83,A,259.390375,267.555875,8.1655, i mean somebody walks in the classroom and you don't know what they're there for you know when they're coming how long they're going to be,1,0
sw2078B-ms98-a,38,B,130.17325,142.464625,12.291375,yeah that that huge it's suppose to be a huge stadium and it's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it and uh they're going to try to make it a real community center out there,1,0
sw2078B-ms98-a,46,B,166.615375,171.625125,5.00975,but uh that new stadium's going to be real nice and i heard that there's uh,1,0
sw2078B-ms98-a,51,B,183.6285,187.0955,3.467,yeah so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame,1,0
sw2078B-ms98-a,69,B,223.241,225.420875,2.179875,is that a tough system to be in,1,0
sw2078B-ms98-a,75,B,237.306875,247.2105,9.903625,that's typical bureaucracy though that's that's i think it's going to be any where you go it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones i don't know sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad,1,0
sw2078B-ms98-a,93,B,295.33875,297.105875,1.767125, that's got to be frustrating,1,0
sw2078B-ms98-a,181,B,533.289875,540.459875,7.17,it just it and i don't know it one of those movies it's not going to be around long it'll be a dollar movie in no time,2,0
sw2079A-ms98-a,21,A,177.55525,188.804125,11.248875,that we'll sell it but he will not build a second one himself    says {agewise} he'll never be able to handle that  yes yes,1,0
sw2079B-ms98-a,34,B,187.290125,196.127875,8.83775,we're having a an architect friend of mine design a house for us and uh that can basically be be be put on any lot in any state any coun- you know so that's kind of the,3,0
sw2080A-ms98-a,45,A,200.71425,207.302125,6.587875,but uh that that's an interesting concept that is this going to be your your permanent home or okay,1,0
sw2080A-ms98-a,65,A,295.69125,305.36625,9.675,yeah well out out that way it shouldn't be to bad i guess your traffic doesn't get too heavy till you head in toward uh toward Dallas a little bit but you should spread out pretty good out there i know,1,0
sw2080B-ms98-a,35,B,165.153875,170.740625,5.58675,it will be pretty sturdy because we have to we we got what we call Santa Ana wind down here,1,0
sw2080B-ms98-a,59,B,253.273875,257.016,3.742125,so the whole wall just opens up it will be all glass,1,0
sw2080B-ms98-a,78,B,346.388625,349.82075,3.432125,yeah it will be a lot of fun we're digging the foundation by hand,1,0
sw2080B-ms98-a,79,B,349.82075,352.48725,2.6665,yeah the first floor's going to be underground,1,0
sw2080B-ms98-a,81,B,353.573,356.830625,3.257625,and it of course it will be open on the south and north end,1,0
sw2082A-ms98-a,7,A,25.757625,32.996875,7.23925,yeah i i would have figured that some of the factories may be contributing as much as as uh automobiles ,1,0
sw2082A-ms98-a,30,A,140.3765,154.759875,14.383375,well uh in uh San Antonio the parking downtown i work downtown and the parking is so dadgum expensive you basically have to car pool to be able to afford to park it costs seventy five dollars a month just to park my car ,1,0
sw2082A-ms98-a,47,A,230.546375,238.787875,8.2415,and there just happens to not be one convenient to where i live so if if there were i would ride the bus,1,0
sw2082B-ms98-a,44,B,257.365625,263.893375,6.52775,and in the summer time it seems to be worse because it there's no air to blow it out you know it's it's horrible,1,0
sw2083B-ms98-a,42,B,151.071,154.94675,3.87575,i've never camped on the coast before i've always thought it would be fun,1,0
sw2083B-ms98-a,49,B,170.73525,172.4685,1.73325,sounds like that would be a mess,1,0
sw2083B-ms98-a,71,B,228.486375,236.93125,8.444875,i guess it gets pretty cold in that part of country in November i mean here it's pretty unpredictable it could be cold or it could be really warm in that time of the year so,2,0
sw2083B-ms98-a,89,B,289.074625,295.06725,5.992625,i guess really the most times i've been camping would i ha- i would have to say it would be Colorado and New Mexico in that area,1,0
sw2085A-ms98-a,22,A,118.882875,127.559125,8.67625,i think that would be an excellent  and would make women go to work sometimes if they knew their kids were being taken care of they could go visit them during the day ,1,0
sw2085A-ms98-a,27,A,152.503375,156.642625,4.13925,and the same thing for insurance what you predict you're going to be paying for insurance,1,0
sw2085A-ms98-a,102,A,461.648375,466.748375,5.1,and it'd be nice if your you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing,1,0
sw2085A-ms98-a,104,A,470.6275,474.143125,3.515625,what else i'd like to be able to to evaluate your boss,1,0
sw2085B-ms98-a,19,B,47.051625,51.437375,4.38575,would be the uh  the availability of the health insurance,1,0
sw2085B-ms98-a,34,B,133.51175,137.66725,4.1555,but i can see how it would be a real benefit,1,0
sw2085B-ms98-a,39,B,168.80175,171.6165,2.81475,well that can i can see where that might be important,1,0
sw2085B-ms98-a,87,B,334.47475,342.847,8.37225,there are a lot of teachers out there that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors,1,0
sw2085B-ms98-a,101,B,399.111375,407.31275,8.201375,you know i went to college late on in life and i realize that hey you know it's nothing but four years of endurance and you might be teachable you know what i ,1,0
sw2085B-ms98-a,136,B,524.799875,533.03025,8.230375,that that is something that i think needs to be expanded on specially in the in the large market place you know the major corporation,1,0
sw2085B-ms98-a,150,B,578.93375,587.385875,8.452125,you know the work they do could be totally eliminated and not that they aren't working not that they aren't trying or anything it's just that their jobs are useless ,1,0
sw2086A-ms98-a,54,A,273.1675,277.80475,4.63725,oh this is terr- uh you shouldn't be talking about this right before you're while you're fixing dinner ,1,0
sw2086A-ms98-a,56,A,279.6465,292.309375,12.662875,that's right you should be careful  that's pretty funny but my dad used to tell stories you know about the way they eat chickens but i never we never we lived in the suburbs we we bought everything in a grocery store,1,0
sw2086A-ms98-a,67,A,321.286375,324.7745,3.488125,well that's that's supposed to be um the trend of the future,1,0
sw2086B-ms98-a,10,B,71.584125,75.648375,4.06425,and that's going to it's going to be really good ,1,0
sw2086B-ms98-a,16,B,92.85575,96.332875,3.477125,it will be in a little while i'm trying to get it get it ready early,1,0
sw2086B-ms98-a,41,B,217.35125,220.379875,3.028625,and i'd just be,1,0
sw2087A-ms98-a,10,A,50.7535,64.447375,13.693875,that that would be important for me that that there wasn't that it was optional that if if every person and i could pick a time i guess rather than worrying about whether it was one years or two years suppose it were to be uh eighteen months,2,0
sw2087A-ms98-a,11,A,64.447375,77.631125,13.18375,uh if every citizen were required to participate in public service and could choose from a sort of a menu of what jobs would might be available at any given time,1,0
sw2087A-ms98-a,13,A,82.62175,93.195125,10.573375,you know that the person were just unable to participate i guess i would not be against that as a requirement i i'm not sure the country needs it but i don't know that i would be against it and it,2,0
sw2087A-ms98-a,14,A,93.195125,97.827625,4.6325,it seems to be it would be important that nobody could c- c- to opt out,2,0
sw2087A-ms98-a,17,A,137.338875,151.50275,14.163875,twenty five or pick some clock age that that would say you would have to give a certain number of years and you could you could say well i i could go in the army i could go in the navy i could go into civil service i could be a forest ranger a hospital attendant or whatever and ,1,0
sw2087A-ms98-a,18,A,151.50275,155.808,4.30525,and i guess some jobs that might be higher risk you might want to compensate,1,0
sw2087A-ms98-a,22,A,163.35775,169.9425,6.58475,uh like you can go go in the army for eighteen months or you can be a forest ranger for two years or something ,1,0
sw2087A-ms98-a,27,A,187.349875,199.29975,11.949875,uh it it seems like we tend to be seem to be focused in on as long as it were equal and equitable it would be okay but uh how do you feel about whether it's something that the country needs or what the benefits would be,4,0
sw2087A-ms98-a,34,A,249.13325,260.7145,11.58125,uh we could address with with manpower everything from like well like national parks began to be in a state of decline because we can't fund their repair and some of them were built in a period during the depression when,1,0
sw2087A-ms98-a,41,A,298.479875,309.218375,10.7385,so i wouldn't i guess i wouldn't feel like there would be a required compensation as any sort of uh the army approach room board and forty bucks a month to uh spend at the P X ,1,0
sw2087A-ms98-a,44,A,315.708,328.809625,13.101625,yeah well that would be back in the and he didn't have much more than that uh back in the sixties or so i mean it's a little more money than that but it wasn't very much it was you you didn't do much other than buy a car or maybe have enough money to send home to a wife,1,0
sw2087A-ms98-a,49,A,337.367375,352.142125,14.77475,i think it's good that people feel that they commit themselves to a country or to that they've if you offer of yourself you feel differently afterwards i think about the fact that you've put yourself into a country as opposed to expect everything to be given to you,1,0
sw2087B-ms98-a,16,B,114.38325,124.254125,9.870875,this ought to be an option at least you know to be uh some sort of a either domestic public service or a foreign type you know Peace Corps type of thing,2,0
sw2087B-ms98-a,25,B,200.058875,206.74175,6.682875,i think uh i think there's a number of reasons that it would be good to have it as a uh requirement,1,0
sw2087B-ms98-a,27,B,213.316375,219.040875,5.7245,i think that uh there's a lot to be gained and a certain amount of discipline and uh,1,0
sw2087B-ms98-a,31,B,230.36725,242.874625,12.507375,so i think uh you know also there's probably there's uh a lot to be said for uh you know the good that would be uh become of the public service works it might be uh and that aspect be helpful,4,0
sw2089A-ms98-a,36,A,140.892625,152.47325,11.580625,that seems to be what the the bass like and what you can catch with the lures so that's that's generally what i fish for you know because_1 i don't particularly like to eat fish i just like to catch them_1 and throw them_1 back,1,0
sw2089A-ms98-a,121,A,478.72775,486.981125,8.253375,yeah now Ray Roberts i haven't been over there but i've i understand there's quite a few people who have been i- i think that's really going to be a good bass lake,1,0
sw2089A-ms98-a,137,A,540.422125,546.750875,6.32875, some of them_1 it takes a little while to get them to do what what you think they ought to be done,1,0
sw2089B-ms98-a,82,B,342.506125,353.75175,11.245625,and uh you know i find those to be pretty good they uh the Texas Fisherman they uh they do cover a pretty broad range of fishing but they cover a lot spend a lot of time on salt water you know,1,0
sw2089B-ms98-a,117,B,498.959125,503.186625,4.2275,i just i just i thought that it might be convenient for me sometime to just,1,0
sw2090A-ms98-a,21,A,72.46725,80.58225,8.115,um right now my actual job is a news reporter but uh if i could do anything i wanted to do it would be to sing professionally,1,0
sw2090A-ms98-a,30,A,98.38275,107.951875,9.569125,uh no not much um my day is usually pretty full my schedule is like from nine to five thirty but i could be at work from anytime you know from nine -til ,1,0
sw2090A-ms98-a,64,A,223.0045,226.394125,3.389625, that would be great if someone came and heard it and they were like i want that voice,1,0
sw2090A-ms98-a,69,A,241.632125,249.14325,7.511125,yeah that would be great then i could be getting paid for something i love to do not that i don't like reporting but i'd love it,2,0
sw2090A-ms98-a,76,A,276.928875,281.76275,4.833875,so i'm trying to be sen- sensible too at the same time,1,0
sw2090B-ms98-a,69,B,239.885625,242.730625,2.845,make your hobby into a business that would be pretty good huh,1,0
sw2091A-ms98-a,23,A,186.85075,196.944625,10.093875,yeah i think that's the that's also has a lot to do with uh today's society you know in in the past the uh the woman was suppose to be at home cooking for the men who were working ,1,0
sw2091A-ms98-a,24,A,196.944625,210.153625,13.209,nowadays it's like everything is so is is so integrated a man can be a mother nowadays you know it's like just like uh what was that movie uh Mister Mom seven years ago,1,0
sw2091A-ms98-a,26,A,218.250125,229.920625,11.6705,you don't have to be a woman to be a babysitter you can be a guy you don't have to be a man to be uh you know the president of a corporation it's it's not it's not what you are it's what your abilities are ,5,0
sw2091A-ms98-a,28,A,243.7325,256.5685,12.836,nowadays that you know there's there's really no difference is is you know the the law the law says there's no difference so more women are are taking that opportunity to be in those spots,1,0
sw2091B-ms98-a,5,B,21.088625,35.433,14.344375,been surpassed by anything else than uh that because most women seem to be taking into careers and working now and changing the way the family situation is because they're now working and we have to have people to babysit and such,1,0
sw2091B-ms98-a,18,B,139.89475,154.311625,14.416875,and then it got to be that you know with the industrial age i think the women uh were the ones staying at home and not as involved in like a big operation as a farm and their the work was more confined to the household chores,1,0
sw2091B-ms98-a,21,B,175.5555,187.557125,12.001625,and then she got to be kind of in the house when that wasn't needed as much and now she's kind of like back out of the house but not working for the family business working you know somewhere else,1,0
sw2091B-ms98-a,30,B,298.12475,308.20575,10.081,you know for women to be more acce- you know accepted into those kinds of areas and to have progressed education and {experiencewise} i mean,1,0
sw2091B-ms98-a,31,B,308.20575,317.800875,9.595125,starting with women working a lot in the work force in the last twenty years it takes awhile for somebody to really gain enough skills to be a CEO,1,0
sw2092B-ms98-a,69,B,236.957125,246.886125,9.929,well s- sort of we're probably like most Am-   i guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got at the end of the month and we know what bills have to be paid,1,0
sw2092B-ms98-a,70,B,246.886125,252.3375,5.451375,and uh we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with with the monthly budget so,1,0
sw2092B-ms98-a,92,B,326.03375,339.908875,13.875125,well especially being a college student you your i don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving you know that effects the budget especially around uh Christmas time it's the end of the semester you've got finals and you've got lots of bills i would suspect,1,0
sw2093A-ms98-a,56,A,274.09825,284.49175,10.3935,maybe it was because_1 it was too dry they finally started making zucchini and i'm not sure when a good time to plant those is if if they should be planted early or later it seems like all i got was,1,0
sw2093A-ms98-a,61,A,306.148875,308.6065,2.457625,it may not be it may not be,2,0
sw2093A-ms98-a,69,A,325.048375,335.619,10.570625,go ahead well i was just going to say we  it's a little over six or seven minutes so whenever you feel comfortable about concluding well i'm um that'd be fine,1,0
sw2093B-ms98-a,7,B,74.65075,85.921125,11.270375,my mother was real heavy into crafts and i would help her with whatever she happened to be doing and then she would go to these uh arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework,1,0
sw2093B-ms98-a,53,B,313.448375,317.2345,3.786125,about the same time that you plant okra because_1 it's supposed to be warm,1,0
sw2094A-ms98-a,27,A,147.426625,152.90825,5.481625,which would be horrible because the there's nothing i mean that's such a spectacle it'd be a shame to ruin it,2,0
sw2094A-ms98-a,39,A,247.040375,253.7555,6.715125,uh individ- being individually responsible a- as uh  in order to be group responsible,1,0
sw2094A-ms98-a,45,A,282.22325,292.929125,10.705875,i suspect that the pub- that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure uh come to bear on the companies that deal with it and probably the only way that can happen is for um,1,0
sw2094B-ms98-a,47,B,264.343,276.371625,12.028625,and in the case of air pollution it simply might turn out at some point down the road to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems and everything else,1,0
sw2095B-ms98-a,9,B,56.44325,69.083875,12.640625,yes i was just talking to my son today he's up in Boston and it was twenty nine there and it was you know in the seventies out here and it was really uh  he really wished he could be  rather than there,1,0
sw2095B-ms98-a,21,B,135.38525,139.336875,3.951625,you must well uh -t it must be quite a bit hotter down there isn't it,1,0
sw2095B-ms98-a,37,B,204.113875,212.635875,8.522,i tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate uh uh it doesn't doe- some people say uh they they like to watch the changing of the seasons but,1,0
sw2096A-ms98-a,4,A,17.576125,25.7805,8.204375,yeah i have some basic concerns about it as well uh not just the invasion of privacy but the the chance of uh false positive be- being reported,1,0
sw2096A-ms98-a,7,A,36.840375,42.083,5.242625,and you're pretty much uh assumed to be guilty until proven innocent by the test results,1,0
sw2096A-ms98-a,24,A,134.53025,143.211375,8.681125,yeah uh according to uh to the way that that our test is set up apparently everyone is supposed to be tested within a five year period,1,0
sw2096A-ms98-a,25,A,143.211375,150.274875,7.0635,and uh they they do it on a random basis i'm not sure how they can guarantee that everybody is going to be tested within five years if it really is random,1,0
sw2096A-ms98-a,80,A,387.894625,401.881125,13.9865,i- i- i fully expect that that any test results that comeback for me would be negative that in in the event that one would be positive there's no recourse other than get yourself a lawyer or go to this counseling session and admit guilt uh they won't accept anything else,2,0
sw2096B-ms98-a,34,B,159.10775,171.563625,12.455875,so that whatever is left in the hopper you know it's it's um uh that's when you'd be tested and then when you were tested then it'd be taken out of there so that's that's how they said they would uh do it over a five year period,2,0
sw2096B-ms98-a,64,B,281.839875,293.117375,11.2775,and uh but yeah they're they're just adamant that they're not going to be you know tested and they're going to fight it and um you know try and um see what they can do that it's an invasion of privacy,1,0
sw2096B-ms98-a,91,B,400.922375,411.33875,10.416375,oh yeah yeah yeah because you'd be strongly into denial  it's just like well we know you take it we've got the positive test results and you're going i don't i don't ,1,0
sw2096B-ms98-a,97,B,433.05575,437.603,4.54725,um  yeah because they're not as reliable as the government wants them to be,1,0
sw2096B-ms98-a,100,B,442.649,447.5595,4.9105, so i don't know it could just be rumors that spread around you know when they,1,0
sw2096B-ms98-a,109,B,470.357125,474.856,4.498875,yeah that that to me yeah it'd be very hard to believe too,1,0
sw2101A-ms98-a,56,A,197.765875,210.930875,13.165,i notice that um since we moved here that we we did get the cable TV and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed,1,0
sw2101A-ms98-a,70,A,269.25675,280.13875,10.882,right and so we we have really enjoyed that and it's really nice not to be running out some of the video rentals can be expensive and,2,0
sw2101A-ms98-a,81,A,324.215,333.795,9.58,you know if if i have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show  if i ever decide to tune it in again,1,0
sw2101A-ms98-a,82,A,333.795,337.348625,3.553625,the only one i've ever seen and it'll be showing again,1,0
sw2101B-ms98-a,47,B,279.5075,283.797875,4.290375,yeah well going to the movie can be unbelievable,1,0
sw2102A-ms98-a,4,A,9.563125,16.891875,7.32875,and the idea that that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space,1,0
sw2102A-ms98-a,42,A,186.782,199.105625,12.323625,i haven't seen the Electric Company in a long time i i remember it when i was younger of you know catching it on PBS but uh i don't think they show it must be in maybe it's in if it was in repeats but they're not making new ones,1,0
sw2102A-ms98-a,62,A,277.5425,290.04675,12.50425,the idea i i think that's one of the things i like about Star Trek and is is the even in for kids watching it some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff i don't let my little ones watch it but the imagination of look what we can do,1,0
sw2102A-ms98-a,63,A,290.04675,293.6005,3.55375,you know in the future this is perhaps this will be possible,1,0
sw2102A-ms98-a,89,A,387.296375,395.238,7.941625,my folks didn't my folks i'm not even sure if we had one when i was really little that may be why bu- they probably didn't have a TV until i got to be,2,0
sw2102B-ms98-a,43,B,186.365625,188.482125,2.1165,oh that would be a shame,1,0
sw2104B-ms98-a,7,B,19.94325,24.635125,4.691875,the people uh i wouldn't consider to be a threat at all,1,0
sw2105A-ms98-a,37,A,175.137875,187.35875,12.220875,last year i was kind of  thinking he sure did get in a slump but they're saying this year their predictions is that he's really gonna come out of it and be on top,1,0
sw2105B-ms98-a,2,B,8.950375,16.5985,7.648125,and they really don't have an excess of catchers and it's really kind of kind of late to you know to start be trying to trade for somebody,1,0
sw2105B-ms98-a,43,B,143.432875,151.638625,8.20575,um-hum they sure are wouldn't it be something to have a World Series between Da- the Rangers and the Astros ,1,0
sw2105B-ms98-a,46,B,157.8835,160.201375,2.317875,that's right wouldn't that be something,1,0
sw2105B-ms98-a,61,B,199.870625,209.327375,9.45675,yeah they were saying something about this may be his last year with the Rangers though apparently they i think his contract is up after the end of this year and they're not sure they're gonna be able to sign him again,2,0
sw2105B-ms98-a,70,B,232.015125,235.828375,3.81325,is there gonna be a ticket increase this year price do you know,1,0
sw2107A-ms98-a,19,A,81.0355,95.442625,14.407125,and they didn't used to be actually but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well  so i put them outside once i got a house and they're doing great out there they love it but the other one the first one i got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there,1,0
sw2107A-ms98-a,52,A,209.36725,216.47525,7.108,oh yeah and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat and you go crazy thinking it might be yours,1,0
sw2107A-ms98-a,115,A,457.0125,460.40775,3.39525,it wouldn't have no that would be a problem ,1,0
sw2107A-ms98-a,127,A,504.438,507.386375,2.948375,oh i wouldn't either there'd be no way,1,0
sw2107B-ms98-a,36,B,120.298625,133.148875,12.85025,oh well he lived through it oh i couldn't believe it we went through like twenty two hundred dollars worth of vet bills the the cat almost died and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat oh he loves life now,1,0
sw2107B-ms98-a,129,B,436.155125,438.43375,2.278625,it will be yes,1,0
sw2107B-ms98-a,142,B,490.8085,504.877375,14.068875,oh yeah oh  the whole time i was pregnant they kept saying are you getting rid of your cats are you getting rid of your cats you can't be pregnant and have cats i'm like uh no no no right the child will learn to like cats and deal with them i'm sorry we are not getting rid of the cats,1,0
sw2108A-ms98-a,18,A,99.491375,113.228625,13.73725,that was a bad a bad place to be especially right there on the water at night especially if it i mean if it were summer you're all right because it probably wasn't too cold but uh probably the worst one that ever happened to me was in when i lived in South Dakota,1,0
sw2108B-ms98-a,5,B,24.99025,32.0155,7.02525,and the wind started blowing and it was one of my earlier trips to be really out in the middle of,1,0
sw2108B-ms98-a,13,B,94.474125,102.220875,7.74675,and we could believe that we were out in that at that time and it uh it can be quite a horror story i guess and i,1,0
sw2108B-ms98-a,69,B,548.952625,558.03,9.077375,yeah you have to get pretty far out of the Dallas area to uh be able to see the stars and uh we do that on the camp outs ,1,0
sw2109A-ms98-a,66,A,387.7325,401.287875,13.555375,well just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is be able to do that to research it and be able to mimic a person uh uh with the kinds of problems that he had ,2,0
sw2109B-ms98-a,11,B,77.47025,85.649375,8.179125,yeah i- i- i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the FBI uh going i guess ,1,0
sw2110A-ms98-a,10,A,40.48475,54.866625,14.381875,um-hum or it could be like the draft where you know before they draft you they ta- y- you get a physical anyway so when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical and if there's nothing physically wrong with you then you're drafted it doesn't matter how rich you are ,1,0
sw2110A-ms98-a,11,A,54.866625,56.659,1.792375,that would be good,1,0
sw2110A-ms98-a,23,A,90.1,101.0045,10.9045,well that's true the America's paying all this money to have other people give uh aid to other countries so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time,1,0
sw2110A-ms98-a,32,A,133.367125,140.1875,6.820375,yeah i i think well that's probably the i- i don't know whether their idea is to be within the country or outside the country,1,0
sw2110A-ms98-a,34,A,150.876875,156.55125,5.674375,yeah that would be neat yeah sort of like an exchange program uh-huh,1,0
sw2110A-ms98-a,36,A,159.6805,162.326125,2.645625,yeah that'd be sort of neat,1,0
sw2110A-ms98-a,59,A,257.66275,271.5895,13.92675,like this thing this is a pretty good idea i didn't even know they were thinking about it i wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone somewhere is really uh thinking that uh it'd be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service,1,0
sw2110A-ms98-a,73,A,346.721625,349.953375,3.23175,uh-huh  that would be neat,1,0
sw2110A-ms98-a,76,A,356.541,370.22,13.679,um-hum well that would be sort of interesting because_1 then you get people from other countries i mean other parts of the state you know of course Pittsburgh would say you know oh find the better cheaper ways of burning coal you know  yeah,1,0
sw2110B-ms98-a,3,B,10.747625,23.582,12.834375,uh be required to do s- public service for a year or two and i was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family,2,0
sw2110B-ms98-a,12,B,67.973125,79.766375,11.79325,uh i thought it a good idea too though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money,1,0
sw2110B-ms98-a,21,B,139.2575,148.094,8.8365,well i thought it'd be a good idea if maybe you took the some of the kids and had them go over to other countries and children from their countries came over to ours too,1,0
sw2110B-ms98-a,79,B,444.451125,449.513625,5.0625,you know on the schedule but then it seems like it might be longer than a week,1,0
sw2110B-ms98-a,93,B,481.236875,490.526625,9.28975,let's see one of my friends had a roommate that worked for TI and she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat so she ran off copies of the thing,1,0
sw2110B-ms98-a,100,B,509.998125,516.796,6.797875, and it shouldn't be too  right now anyway because_1 they've been laying off so many people,1,0
sw2111A-ms98-a,63,A,272.3775,279.784,7.4065,yeah yeah i- i felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until i realized they would be thrown away so,1,0
sw2111A-ms98-a,104,A,481.192875,488.639125,7.44625,um-hum it gets to be uh i guess you have to make it a habit i mean you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit,1,0
sw2111B-ms98-a,44,B,166.53525,169.770125,3.234875,it's just yeah it would be nice if it could be more,2,0
sw2111B-ms98-a,132,B,465.05075,470.482625,5.431875,certain file type things away and i just think it's such a hassle it seems like it would be,1,0
sw2111B-ms98-a,134,B,471.562375,475.091,3.528625,it'd be easy to take it all i don't know of course i don't know all that about,1,0
sw2113A-ms98-a,21,A,90.498625,96.590375,6.09175,i did too   that's why i was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part but,1,0
sw2114B-ms98-a,21,B,116.963625,130.380375,13.41675, i mean i i'm all for registration in the sense that uh a a a lawful person can go down and get a gun an- and maybe you shouldn't be given one the day that you go down they should be able to do a check i think possibly an-,2,0
sw2116A-ms98-a,6,A,9.270125,15.96675,6.696625,okay well they're rebuilding right now yet i think it's going to take them a couple more years before they can be a really good team,1,0
sw2116A-ms98-a,29,A,115.688375,118.248625,2.56025,so i don't know if he's going to be in shape to,1,0
sw2116A-ms98-a,37,A,135.992875,138.98925,2.996375,uh-huh well that turned out to be a good game,1,0
sw2116A-ms98-a,63,A,275.490625,287.972,12.481375,yeah i think the owners have somewhat lost sight on that because uh they are all wealthy people and uh the expect that uh the average Joe is going to be able to to go to a game and uh pay for that type of entertainment,1,0
sw2116A-ms98-a,68,A,307.481875,313.288625,5.80675,and uh every every opportunity there is to make a dollar he seems to be exploiting that,1,0
sw2116A-ms98-a,71,A,322.467125,336.463625,13.9965,and uh i don't think that's going to die very quickly he is getting some support there were a lot of people that are uh that were skeptical and the Cowboys are coming back and they have a pretty good team Troy Aikman looks like to be looks like he's got the star qualities for a quarterback,1,0
sw2116A-ms98-a,76,A,365.96325,370.76825,4.805,yeah they've got an awful lot of good draft picks coming up it's going to be interesting to see what they do with them,1,0
sw2116A-ms98-a,81,A,394.487125,399.244625,4.7575,i don't know what Philadelphia's going to do without Buddy Ryan it might be interesting to see,1,0
sw2116A-ms98-a,104,A,490.28425,494.303,4.01875,he'd be lucky if he can get an assistant uh job someplace,1,0
sw2116A-ms98-a,117,A,565.4885,579.491375,14.002875,possibly but that's that's uh one in a million shot if they have the talent to be in the NFL they're going to get drafted and make a pro team there aren't going to be too many people that that'll make uh the NFL out of uh WWALF,2,0
sw2116A-ms98-a,118,A,579.491375,585.46975,5.978375,it will be like Italian basketball with the uh with with the uh NBA,1,0
sw2116A-ms98-a,121,A,595.492375,598.907,3.414625,i think it will be a good year the Cowboys are showing constant ,1,0
sw2116B-ms98-a,55,B,166.995375,171.3085,4.313125,but uh there's a lot of parity now compared to what it used to be,1,0
sw2116B-ms98-a,71,B,228.779,233.994875,5.215875,fun and for the uh competition that used to be in the older days,1,0
sw2116B-ms98-a,172,B,528.77725,541.724625,12.947375,the way people talk about uh there's not that it won't be as good as the NFL will because uh there's not that many good or quality football players i can't believe that ,1,0
sw2116B-ms98-a,191,B,593.498625,598.907,5.408375,i'm i'm looking forward to the season i think it's going to be fun yeah,1,0
sw2118A-ms98-a,8,A,41.94275,51.572875,9.630125,as we said well nothing's happening in the war because now they're interviewing the what seems to be dozens of Mideast experts all at once,1,0
sw2118B-ms98-a,33,B,245.4095,258.674875,13.265375,and there seems to be no purpose um you know the person has stated you know some opinion or fact or whatever and that should be the end of it and they just keep on and on and on,2,0
sw2118B-ms98-a,40,B,285.648875,293.183,7.534125,oh well we're having sunshine i think it's gonna be up in the seventies today so,1,0
sw2120A-ms98-a,5,A,24.169625,30.6305,6.460875,and i you know we we keep saying oh yes we feel someday a woman will be president,1,0
sw2121A-ms98-a,22,A,146.905875,151.966875,5.061,there doesn't seem to be much emission from them but i'm not sure about the rest of the country,1,0
sw2121A-ms98-a,28,A,186.893625,191.672625,4.779,yeah them there must be uh um some of the some of the uh,1,0
sw2121A-ms98-a,70,A,420.90825,429.266125,8.357875, yeah we could also uh push for legislation for uh rapid transit systems uh this country seems to be a little behind on that,1,0
sw2121A-ms98-a,87,A,517.2495,525.94975,8.70025,well i was gonna to say right you could put it in you c- you could it could be installed like a catalytic converter i mean i guess you could take those off too but,1,0
sw2121A-ms98-a,97,A,559.997,569.668875,9.671875,but it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that but that's a that's a thought no you're right and that will solve uh a lot of problems i don't know if you uh,1,0
sw2121A-ms98-a,98,A,569.668875,575.59875,5.929875,if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that,1,0
sw2121B-ms98-a,29,B,151.389625,163.1815,11.791875,yeah i've noticed locally a major problem is Kodak um it's interesting because in order to uh keep with the EPA standards which which tend to be visible,1,0
sw2121B-ms98-a,31,B,168.368875,176.064625,7.69575,yeah people get up in the morning in that neighborhood and they've got this black ash on their cars   you know seems to be,1,0
sw2121B-ms98-a,51,B,235.68575,241.768625,6.082875,i mean the stuff i've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit,1,0
sw2121B-ms98-a,52,B,241.768625,252.833875,11.06525,um overstated that a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all um yeah i'm not an expert,1,0
sw2121B-ms98-a,68,B,301.583,310.757,9.174,they didn't say what they just said they thought acid rain's contribution may be less than was previously suspected um but it may be other natural things at work,2,0
sw2121B-ms98-a,108,B,511.19825,519.30775,8.1095,i guess the difficulty would be to  somebody could obviously just take it right off the tailpipe again so you'd probably have to build it right into the muffler or something ,1,0
sw2121B-ms98-a,111,B,524.677375,528.989,4.311625,you could take catalytic but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off,1,0
sw2122A-ms98-a,37,A,194.543,208.967625,14.424625,and also you know it's like for for presentations it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a on a PC it can be easily represented on a on a PC you know like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all this all these numbers,2,0
sw2122A-ms98-a,67,A,349.10375,352.072125,2.968375,and that that that's the way it would be you know it's like ,1,0
sw2122B-ms98-a,109,B,338.15075,341.853875,3.703125,oh that would be great ,1,0
sw2123B-ms98-a,22,B,81.25925,84.34125,3.082,yeah hers probably would be the best,1,0
sw2124A-ms98-a,7,A,14.8515,24.79675,9.94525,that'd be good for a dinner party that you know to cook that because_1 you don't have to deal with eight different things coming out at once is that what you usually cook when you have a party,1,0
sw2124A-ms98-a,38,A,206.418125,216.53175,10.113625,but i did bake apples so that it would be not brownies you know i figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies,1,0
sw2125A-ms98-a,41,A,276.07,284.317375,8.247375,i and and you know at a time when they're afraid of their shadow all they need is you know some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent they'd be awake all ,1,0
sw2125A-ms98-a,43,A,287.16725,300.231875,13.064625,you know she's not afraid of her shadow anymore that i'm i'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we'll be able to go uh this summer you know even if it's like over to Rio Dosa for a couple of days or something to get them used to it and get them started uh,1,0
sw2125B-ms98-a,56,B,328.498,335.310125,6.812125,but yeah that's there isn't there's an awful lot of things set up you know just any anything you want to do like like you say it can be uh,1,0
sw2129A-ms98-a,4,A,3.9055,11.41,7.5045,besides y- besides your salary what's what's the most the thing that you would consider to be most important as a benefit,1,0
sw2129A-ms98-a,41,A,210.43975,213.4025,2.96275,that sounds like it might be a really good idea,1,0
sw2129A-ms98-a,80,A,370.564875,379.40325,8.838375,it seems like everybody has it used to be that they used to give like two weeks a year and now they give one week after the first six months,1,0
sw2129B-ms98-a,11,B,36.034125,43.641125,7.607,to uh me today would probably be uh something to do with retirement benefits,1,0
sw2129B-ms98-a,12,B,43.641125,53.88,10.238875,at at this point in my life though i'm i'm i'm a little older probably than you know than the typical new employee would be anyway uh,1,0
sw2129B-ms98-a,21,B,86.815625,94.557375,7.74175,when you get to the point where you're looking forward to it then it gets to be important because you've got to do some planning for it uh you know especially if the company is not doing it for you,1,0
sw2129B-ms98-a,61,B,316.138875,321.86125,5.722375,uh put your money all in the right in the s- you know in the right pockets i guess it would be a way to say it,1,0
sw2129B-ms98-a,63,B,327.992,337.719375,9.727375,yeah the yeah the medical insurance would really be a lot more important if you had uh if you had children i guess if you're of child bearing age then it's important too you know because,1,0
sw2130A-ms98-a,16,A,114.937875,123.625625,8.68775,how close the the the vote was i'm uh i mean almost certainly would have to be Just based on the sheer numbers of uh ,1,0
sw2130A-ms98-a,42,A,217.615375,223.616875,6.0015,uh it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the this opposition will,1,0
sw2130A-ms98-a,63,A,323.7885,333.079875,9.291375,they had i think they in when they be- became a country they more than or more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore and uh,1,0
sw2130B-ms98-a,71,B,387.503625,398.28825,10.784625,uh mutually exclusive interests either Israel is going to occupy the area or the Arabs are going to occupy the area and i'm just not sure that that there's going to be any easy permanent solution,1,0
sw2131A-ms98-a,41,A,159.660375,169.070125,9.40975, but i i'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music,1,0
sw2131B-ms98-a,67,B,276.358375,280.214125,3.85575,that that would be that would be nice ,2,0
sw2131B-ms98-a,110,B,467.520625,471.144,3.623375,that would be gr- great if they weren't too worn out at the time,1,0
sw2131B-ms98-a,112,B,473.413125,477.111625,3.6985,is there not you you'd well you'd think there would be ,1,0
sw2131B-ms98-a,121,B,502.684875,511.93375,9.248875,think there'd be a market for i i'm sure you could find old players for them_1 but that'd cost a fortune if you could find them_1 that worked  oh ,1,0
sw2136A-ms98-a,58,A,210.060625,215.72325,5.662625, but it would that wouldn't be fair if they tested just people with strenuous jobs ,1,0
sw2136A-ms98-a,74,A,280.233625,287.33325,7.099625,because_1 they check our bosses and everything and i think that's the way it should be if they going to check you know that way you can't stay well they didn't check my boss ,1,0
sw2136A-ms98-a,96,A,348.482625,355.756875,7.27425,on one of my our our thing is they said that you'd have to the way the test is you'd have to really be smoking for it to show up and i don't think that's right,1,0
sw2136A-ms98-a,178,A,595.82675,600.5355,4.70875,but see now they they would be out of his system but if he was to be tested,2,0
sw2136B-ms98-a,163,B,568.005125,577.333875,9.32875,and then also after you know they can find out whenever their prescription ends and then find out you know how long it will take for that to be out of their system and then test them again,1,0
sw2137A-ms98-a,19,A,124.846875,137.616625,12.76975,to study something that'll give them a job as opposed to it'd be curious be curious if there wa- if there was mandatory do you consider the option of eith- the mandatory military service or volunteer do you think that would be reasonable ,3,0
sw2137A-ms98-a,30,A,217.5585,230.564625,13.006125,and there are a lot of the buildings in downtown areas that that either need demolishing or need fixing up so it would be a good idea  um we've been doing this three or four minutes i think that uh,1,0
sw2137B-ms98-a,9,B,42.155,47.35275,5.19775,i think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal because a lot of times,1,0
sw2137B-ms98-a,20,B,136.758875,147.021875,10.263,i think it would i- in Israel the even the women are are required to to be in the military for a certain period of time uh i was in the military,1,0
sw2139A-ms98-a,61,A,270.670125,276.03125,5.361125,you know usually when they call you it's going to be when you s- right when you sit down to dinner because_1 they know,1,0
sw2139B-ms98-a,111,B,480.22,486.781625,6.561625,and when i when i want to be you know not bothered during the day that's exactly what i do,1,0
sw2139B-ms98-a,128,B,532.74525,535.573625,2.828375,so i imagine we will be,1,0
sw2141A-ms98-a,17,A,46.464125,52.42375,5.959625,it's kind of fun if you've been there before y- you'll be able to relate to uh to the humor that they have in the movie,1,0
sw2141A-ms98-a,75,A,254.347125,257.413875,3.06675,oh i think it'd be great for a for a a child,1,0
sw2141B-ms98-a,40,B,110.72075,115.642,4.92125,scary and intense as i thought it was going to be but toward the end it got got more that way,1,0
sw2141B-ms98-a,55,B,160.35425,169.409125,9.054875,yeah that's the way i under- as a matter of fact my sister believes in uh ghosts and she said that she thinks that's a real uh true portrayal of what it would be like,1,0
sw2145A-ms98-a,67,A,364.666875,372.200625,7.53375,and then you might have more control over uh the the morals that they would be taught rather than,1,0
sw2145A-ms98-a,89,A,437.47725,441.196625,3.719375,i think that they will be more in the work place because,1,0
sw2145A-ms98-a,93,A,448.399125,451.2855,2.886375,so and i would be glad to see that,1,0
sw2145B-ms98-a,24,B,153.252,156.805125,3.553125,i have not to be honest had much experience,1,0
sw2145B-ms98-a,31,B,183.907875,192.3045,8.396625,so i guess my experience is is just with what we did and and so they didn't really go through the child care route they were able to be home together,1,0
sw2145B-ms98-a,41,B,218.682875,220.509375,1.8265,there will be,1,0
sw2145B-ms98-a,44,B,231.114875,234.717,3.602125,sort of rent a mom to be you know not to be crass about it but uh,2,0
sw2145B-ms98-a,45,B,234.717,243.000125,8.283125,uh whether one might conceive  no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate uh um,1,0
sw2145B-ms98-a,50,B,259.341875,264.253125,4.91125,nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession,1,0
sw2145B-ms98-a,60,B,308.52,312.036625,3.516625,it would be a sort of day care but it would be more of a family setting,2,0
sw2145B-ms98-a,66,B,334.896875,345.60125,10.704375,or to put their child into a s- into a home setting where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and,1,0
sw2149A-ms98-a,2,A,0.440625,6,5.559375, so huh what do you think should they uh should young Americans be forced to do a year of service,1,0
sw2149A-ms98-a,10,A,45.7705,57.256,11.4855,yeah i think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two a- and and force them i think that uh i think it'd be i think mo- i think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it,1,0
sw2149A-ms98-a,45,A,334.997,339.48525,4.48825,that that that's real good and i and i bet it gives you a real good feeling to be doing that,1,0
sw2149A-ms98-a,56,A,409.302875,414.720625,5.41775, yeah no neither do i i think it should be completely optional and you know,1,0
sw2149A-ms98-a,62,A,449.999125,452.706875,2.70775,so i can see where that that may be a problem,1,0
sw2149B-ms98-a,2,B,4.485875,11.484,6.998125,i don't i don't think they should be forced but i think they should be en- i guess encouraged to,2,0
sw2149B-ms98-a,26,B,128.2535,131.2835,3.03, i'll be,1,0
sw2150A-ms98-a,38,A,137.2965,146.4835,9.187,i don't know if i could i could prob- it depends on the crime my problem would be that like people to me the like the child people the people that's killing kids,1,0
sw2150A-ms98-a,108,A,457.731375,471.996875,14.2655,but uh you know it's something that has to be done to me if they bring kids into it because now kids are killing and so they going to have to do something with the death penalty or to scare these people i think that's the whole thing they're not scared they know they're not going anywhere,1,0
sw2150A-ms98-a,112,A,489.264,499.997,10.733,but originally in LA they people die all the time just from being in the way at the wrong place you know see you know but i think something should be done for them,1,0
sw2150B-ms98-a,7,B,32.49225,35.99225,3.5,oh yeah that would be a capital crime yeah,1,0
sw2150B-ms98-a,31,B,115.2485,125.466875,10.218375,i don't know you know like i sai- said i do believe in capital punishment but if i were sitting on a jury and had to make the decision  i wouldn't want to have to be the one to make it,1,0
sw2150B-ms98-a,47,B,181.68375,190.465625,8.781875,i definitely think anyone that kills somebody should be in jail i don't think everybody that kills somebody should die,1,0
sw2151A-ms98-a,8,A,33.311125,41.688125,8.377,i'm not sure that that's not a bad {idear} and or the military for a year or two wouldn't be bad for i think it teaches kids how to grow how about_1 yourself,1,0
sw2151B-ms98-a,30,B,120.15025,124.596125,4.445875,yeah but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country too,1,0
sw2151B-ms98-a,31,B,124.596125,136.30425,11.708125,yeah um i'm not i'm not so sure that overseas help helping overseas would be such a hot idea for s- for uh a lot of young ki- people,1,0
sw2151B-ms98-a,32,B,136.30425,140.122375,3.818125,but uh since there is much that needs to be done here,1,0
sw2152A-ms98-a,23,A,65.1445,67.340875,2.196375,is to not be in the big city,1,0
sw2152A-ms98-a,52,A,175.719,181.06175,5.34275,of course at the at the time i worked third shift to be with my kids during the day,1,0
sw2152A-ms98-a,108,A,371.817,375.72525,3.90825,so it's supposed to be real bad driving tomorrow afternoon,1,0
sw2152A-ms98-a,117,A,404.696375,408.789,4.092625,and they say that the driving tomorrow is supposed to be really bad in the afternoon,1,0
sw2153A-ms98-a,18,A,69.724,81.423,11.699,he went the other route i think uh i think the advise i'd give to parents would be to start when they're like four years old today ,1,0
sw2153A-ms98-a,71,A,351.255125,353.67825,2.423125,oh it it would be wonderful,1,0
sw2153A-ms98-a,121,A,543.990375,547.823625,3.83325,that would be interesting well it was good talking to you,1,0
sw2153B-ms98-a,24,B,139.29975,149.46925,10.1695,and uh by the time i was a sophomore i decided that mathematics was really not the thing to be into to find a good job they weren't hiring mathematicians at the time,1,0
sw2153B-ms98-a,43,B,237.235875,247.726125,10.49025,uh if you choose a school that's not well known or it does not have a very good curriculum in uh in the in those areas uh it could be difficult to uh make a career out of it ,1,0
sw2154A-ms98-a,110,A,516.207375,523.0385,6.831125,and they they don't offer any commentary and it gives me a quick chance to to be caught up during the day,1,0
sw2154B-ms98-a,15,B,97.783625,104.660125,6.8765,since i don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite,1,0
sw2154B-ms98-a,17,B,108.810875,112.342875,3.532,there seems to be more and more of it,1,0
sw2154B-ms98-a,42,B,281.665375,285.4815,3.816125,well Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold,1,0
sw2155B-ms98-a,35,B,232.7415,243.728125,10.986625,enjoyable for them that'd that'd be one thing i'd look for along with the uh health care aspects to make sure they had you know that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses,1,0
sw2155B-ms98-a,45,B,295.46375,308.46775,13.004,to uh be in one of these places because some of these people that are just on social security and if they don't have any living relatives perhaps they never had children or if their children you know passed away before they did they can be in some places that are,2,0
sw2155B-ms98-a,48,B,326.713875,341.490625,14.77675,to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything that certainly would be something to to watch for because you've got with some of them being some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in fee,2,0
sw2155B-ms98-a,77,B,493.9935,503.283,9.2895,yeah it would be hard to that's that's why this she was she felt that way too but when it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff,2,0
sw2155B-ms98-a,91,B,554.497625,565.998,11.500375,so it's it's more like living with a big in a big house where it's your turn to to set the table like you're saying or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time yeah that would be nice,1,0
sw2155B-ms98-a,95,B,578.432625,578.930125,0.4975,going to be ,1,0
sw2155B-ms98-a,97,B,579.01875,580.74975,1.731,the people who have to be there,1,0
sw2157A-ms98-a,64,A,284.797625,295.248875,10.45125, he said that uh Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time so sounds like he's going to be all right for next season they're just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder,1,0
sw2157A-ms98-a,80,A,358.82525,365.6,6.77475,i didn't look at the clock when we started talking so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in,1,0
sw2157A-ms98-a,110,A,496.975375,511.3025,14.327125,and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones,1,0
sw2157B-ms98-a,33,B,128.944875,136.898,7.953125,uh there's you know Mike Lynn from the Minnesota Vikings he used to be the general manager starting the World Football League,1,0
sw2158B-ms98-a,63,B,194.680125,209.234875,14.55475,and uh it was uh T-shirts and jeans in the warm weather and jackets and jeans in the short weather uh the thing is here i'm i'm supposed to be an executive you you can uh uh take that or or not depends on where you're looking from,1,0
sw2158B-ms98-a,72,B,266.59475,272.944125,6.349375,well we'll have a day or two that it'll be down near zero as it has been the last two years just before Christmas,1,0
sw2158B-ms98-a,73,B,272.944125,282.033875,9.08975,but at uh uh normally it'll be in the thirties and forties on the coldest days and we've experienced some seventies here uh to eighties recently,1,0
sw2158B-ms98-a,112,B,503.392125,513.312375,9.92025,yeah yeah yeah i used to referee soccer games and uh uh i would use those watches to time the games and i'd be out on the field middle of the field at high noon,1,0
sw2160A-ms98-a,38,A,142.2155,147.279875,5.064375,it doesn't have to do i mean the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere,1,0
sw2160A-ms98-a,58,A,285.537375,294.546375,9.009,that that i see their theory is that if i'm surrounded and i'm going to be caught i'm going to try to pry my way through and they're not going to take me alive,1,0
sw2160A-ms98-a,60,A,299.495875,312.89825,13.402375,you know it's like of course i mean i might be you know the the leading drug dealer here but you won't find me dealing in drugs i mean there's no connection between me and the people that you caught you know,1,0
sw2160B-ms98-a,22,B,58.739375,62.58525,3.845875,oh if i knew that i'd be a very wealthy person,1,0
sw2160B-ms98-a,51,B,271.279125,281.877125,10.598,the dealers the big dealers in drugs may be may be part of the power structure that's keeping us from spending the money in that direction,2,0
sw2161A-ms98-a,7,A,40.1115,52.35875,12.24725,and they've informed us that uh we'd be getting more instructions in the mail in a week or two but we're going to start a separation of our refuse and separating the cans from the paper et cetera,1,0
sw2161B-ms98-a,27,B,156.161,161.958375,5.797375,as far as you know should more be done i think there's i think there's always more that can be done,2,0
sw2161B-ms98-a,30,B,176.966,183.648125,6.682125,and um  i'm sure there are a lot chemicals that that can be recycled that,1,0
sw2161B-ms98-a,42,B,210.94325,212.90225,1.959,i mean that would be great,1,0
sw2162A-ms98-a,34,A,113.732125,122.341625,8.6095,yeah somebody said that uh JR is going to die and that will be end of the season forever i mean the end of the show forever,1,0
sw2162A-ms98-a,62,A,212.89225,219.186375,6.294125,we are lucky enough to now be on a cable system that has four public TV channels,1,0
sw2162A-ms98-a,97,A,426.0465,436.467375,10.420875,i suspect that that's a reference to Thoreau's Fish in the Bucket of Milk but i don't know for sure and i'm not sure what the relevance would be if it were but,1,0
sw2162A-ms98-a,126,A,555.352375,562.553125,7.20075,um-hum yeah i think i would be inclined to do the same thing if we could see anything   ,1,0
sw2162B-ms98-a,12,B,21.111125,24.32,3.208875,well first and foremost it's got to be LA Law ,1,0
sw2162B-ms98-a,24,B,43.769,52.31075,8.54175,i admit that i used to be hooked on Dallas but back way long time ago when Jock died i gave up watching it it just got too funny,1,0
sw2162B-ms98-a,58,B,182.809875,186.199,3.389125,it must be either uh A&E or um,1,0
sw2162B-ms98-a,99,B,319.537625,324.6615,5.123875,it was it should be close enough but i guess they have the antennas pointing it the other way or something,1,0
sw2163B-ms98-a,37,B,127.71075,131.995125,4.284375,sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest,1,0
sw2164A-ms98-a,4,A,18.246625,20.932,2.685375,to be perfectly honest with you hold on a second,1,0
sw2164A-ms98-a,34,A,124.195625,128.67775,4.482125,now see i agree with that i- i don't think a person should be electrocuted or,1,0
sw2164A-ms98-a,35,A,128.67775,133.86475,5.187,hung or you know i- in other words i believe that they should be punished and done away with,1,0
sw2164A-ms98-a,40,A,150.219875,155.82075,5.600875,then at least they have a chance to over the years be proven not guilty,1,0
sw2164A-ms98-a,53,A,194.5905,203.523375,8.932875,and i don't think unless that the cri- that the laws get to the point where people are afraid to do something because they know they'll be punished,1,0
sw2164A-ms98-a,56,A,211.600875,216.056875,4.456,yeah a- you know a- i- i don't know if it would be,1,0
sw2164A-ms98-a,71,A,285.386625,290.555,5.168375,you know that that i really do i believe that that capital punishment should be there,1,0
sw2164A-ms98-a,104,A,419.726,423.9265,4.2005,how do you feel about it do you do you think there should be capital punishment,1,0
sw2164A-ms98-a,106,A,437.674,446.963,9.289,yeah i- i do myself i really think that it's it's all well and good to um be a do-gooder or to to um,1,0
sw2164B-ms98-a,10,B,47.182875,48.653625,1.47075, what other ones would be,1,0
sw2164B-ms98-a,25,B,163.744875,170.58625,6.841375,it'd be funny if it wasn't so   i mean this woman this woman went out and hired somebody to uh,1,0
sw2164B-ms98-a,36,B,205.15025,213.365125,8.214875,well that brings up i guess part of what would be a question is uh you know is i guess you feel like that's a deterrent in uh capital punishment should be,2,0
sw2164B-ms98-a,38,B,220.5115,228.469,7.9575,well it uh  must be i think it's a matter of degree and uh of course uh course it varies from case to case or individual,1,0
sw2164B-ms98-a,59,B,356.226875,365.550375,9.3235,well i tell you what i think that uh you know this may this may be a cause rather the actual  but uh i think that a lot of this is caused by,1,0
sw2164B-ms98-a,61,B,368.506125,370.793625,2.2875,want to be uh,1,0
sw2164B-ms98-a,68,B,403.29675,408.374875,5.078125,well well what seems to be the answer is to concentrate on uh you know the children,1,0
sw2164B-ms98-a,71,B,413.04675,416.983375,3.936625,going to be necessarily workable but it would be uh one way,2,0
sw2164B-ms98-a,89,B,499.771,509.53375,9.76275,that people start uh oh you know repeat about it you know they start to see this violence in a steady diet and uh it's to be uh just,1,0
sw2164B-ms98-a,105,B,569.7505,578.35475,8.60425,and uh there wasn't a thing they could do you know they'd take her down to the juvenile hall and then they'd have to let her go and she'd be back  doing it,1,0
sw2165A-ms98-a,35,A,140.896,146.324125,5.428125,and uh cranberry sauce i- i could eat just that and be satisfied,1,0
sw2166A-ms98-a,19,A,59.68975,68.74375,9.054,i haven't been to Steak and Ale for a long time but my favorite used to be their steak and uh Alaskan king crab oh that was good,1,0
sw2166A-ms98-a,84,A,493.76725,497.73275,3.9655,yeah that sounds pretty neat it'd be worth giving a try,1,0
sw2166B-ms98-a,59,B,219.97725,232.291375,12.314125,if the if the help is is good and they're like they're supposed to be that you know you're you're tempted to give the food a second try but not the people for some reason,1,0
sw2167A-ms98-a,72,A,205.174875,206.92725,1.752375,so they'll be back,1,0
sw2167B-ms98-a,19,B,50.865125,51.963875,1.09875,be- ,1,0
sw2167B-ms98-a,75,B,206.51,210.16,3.65,so next year they'll be back and back with a vengeance,1,0
sw2167B-ms98-a,94,B,312.5,321.377875,8.877875,next year they'll be uh playing and i know Memphis State was even in a few of them_1 where they go- uh couldn't play,1,0
sw2168A-ms98-a,26,A,105.172625,111.00425,5.831625,i think it would be better for the teachers and for the children because we would do away with so much of the burn out that we have,1,0
sw2168A-ms98-a,40,A,175.09675,180.961625,5.864875,and it's not going to be like the kids are going to go a lot longer really if you go year around,1,0
sw2168A-ms98-a,80,A,355.7895,363.8555,8.066,you know now that's sad when there's supposed to be what  you know one thousand what sixty five dollars something like that spent on each pupil,1,0
sw2168A-ms98-a,84,A,383.841125,392.84225,9.001125,we're supposed to teach whatever way that that child has to have it learns the best way and that's going to be quite a ,1,0
sw2168A-ms98-a,90,A,420.45525,429.607125,9.151875,and some of the kids really they shouldn't be in there and they're you know they're not being challenged and they're not being challenged in their home and we always have to teach toward the middle of the road,1,0
sw2168A-ms98-a,115,A,551.813625,555.610375,3.79675,like our principal says i want every child to be on task all the time,1,0
sw2168A-ms98-a,119,A,562.860375,571.191,8.330625,we don't get that  if they finish before their thirty minutes is up then they can go out and play for like maybe five or ten minutes probably be the most,1,0
sw2169A-ms98-a,15,A,102.495125,114.497,12.001875,i'll call you   and they all say that they're the best Visa but you know i definitely have the one that i've so far  picked out to be the best you know because of a low interest rate or whatever,1,0
sw2169A-ms98-a,53,A,315.949875,329.761375,13.8115,so i only get to see her on Thursday through Monday and it's one of those things where they'll say oh your wife's not there and i'll say i'll say no oh well when is she going to be there and i'm like well she's never going to be here yes she's never going to be here so you know,3,0
sw2169A-ms98-a,54,A,329.761375,339.01325,9.251875,oh yeah uh-huh and and they'll keep going until they get that out of you when your wife is going to be here because they want us to be here together because i guess uh it's i-,2,0
sw2169A-ms98-a,65,A,370.486375,380.7045,10.218125,uh a church you know that's doing a raffle or it's some type of boy scouts or it's some type of group or whatever and i automatically you just think oh it's a raffle must be for the kids,1,0
sw2169A-ms98-a,73,A,432.75475,441.004625,8.249875,something else in my kitchen it was all kitchen stuff they put me on and they all called me you know and each one asked me when my wife was going to be here,1,0
sw2169A-ms98-a,80,A,484.29725,494.280375,9.983125,well i think also you know in th- the if men are home during the day they're they're um they might be unemployed men who might be more apt to um,2,0
sw2169A-ms98-a,81,A,494.280375,503.693625,9.41325,you know be at the end of their rope you know and be looking for uh uh a salvation in the sense or looking for a uh saving grace you know i,2,0
sw2169A-ms98-a,83,A,513.487125,526.491875,13.00475,uh you know she may be bored at the time so she'll spend a little bit more time to listen i think you know because she may have finished her work the kids may be taking a nap they may uh they may be playing some place you know or,3,0

sw2180A-ms98-a,15,A,121.318375,132.697375,11.379,and they were being the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there couldn't be a a mistrial of any kind uh the uh,1,0
sw2180A-ms98-a,39,A,312.402,326.4005,13.9985,uh back uh in a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today's standard of living and the the uh level of education of them of so many people now,1,0

sw2180A-ms98-a,53,A,418.112375,427.091625,8.97925,isn't that terrible And uh you know and that certainly uh cannot be said to be uh something that happens everywhere,2,0
sw2180B-ms98-a,13,B,86.238625,98.83175,12.593125,to uh make things easier and uh you know like uh the suggestion that uh maybe the uh a judge should be the one who decides on what the sentence should be rather than the jury,2,0
sw2180B-ms98-a,47,B,395.971625,404.28825,8.316625,and audio tapes and they've they've got you know they've got ways to nail people  to the point where they they really shouldn't even be going to trial,1,0
sw2181A-ms98-a,4,A,9.345625,17.723625,8.378,uh for months and months and months and it was a a genre that i wasn't in the least bit interested in and i usually when i hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good,1,0
sw2181A-ms98-a,43,A,205.50025,219.449875,13.949625,there was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying to be tough and they s had a lot of human character there but when it was the real slapstick moments him versus the criminals kind of thing it just sort of lost the human element became purely a caricature,1,0
sw2181A-ms98-a,65,A,306.659875,315.148875,8.489,the violence in these films part- it mean it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book but on the other hand it makes it seem like,1,0
sw2181A-ms98-a,70,A,348.3995,359.9185,11.519,uh on the one hand i'd like it to be a warning on the other hand i wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee now we want to see the aftermath all the time either,1,0
sw2181A-ms98-a,72,A,364.461375,377.38575,12.924375,but yeah T- Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is sort of the same way they  i guess they figured i mean they know what they're doing and they make the movies good enough i guess i'm a bit of a snob they make the movies good enough to be successful ,1,0
sw2181A-ms98-a,87,A,477.32725,486.657625,9.330375,but i um i'm i'm clearly enough you know i'm i'm clearly an intellectual snob to be going to these kinds of movies i realize that,1,0
sw2181A-ms98-a,88,A,486.657625,493.113875,6.45625,i mean to go to these movies and expect them to be you know other than just just good entertainment kind of thing,1,0
sw2181A-ms98-a,91,A,511.5725,520.211,8.6385,tend to be hypercritical of these things and then perhaps perhaps it's unfair because i i i must admit i enjoy these movies um,1,0
sw2181A-ms98-a,107,A,582.9265,590.262,7.3355,yeah there must be Texas people as near as i can tell no okay i'm from the other coast all right bye bye,1,0

sw2182A-ms98-a,15,A,185.937,193.979,8.042,uh whereas now with it's a kind of fifty fifty split or leaning whatever percentage happens to be in your neighborhood like for our neighborhood we're looking at,1,0
sw2182A-ms98-a,16,A,193.979,203.696375,9.717375,ninety percent working women let's say uh there's no place for the wife to go when she has uh those kind of of stresses to be relieved,1,0
sw2182A-ms98-a,26,A,285.350125,294.499375,9.14925,for lack of a better term women's libber you know we're just the same as men well maybe not and and maybe you shouldn't be exposed to the stress the same way that men have,1,0
sw2182A-ms98-a,33,A,417.953875,430.40275,12.448875,yeah the subject would die before they had to run all the tests that they need   it would be an exhausted test uh how about the the area of role models or roles as it were when you,1,0
sw2182A-ms98-a,35,A,436.475375,444.003625,7.52825,not not arguing that there should be a role for a sex but should there be,2,0
sw2182A-ms98-a,37,A,454.98475,464.173375,9.188625,uh compatibility if you want a couple to be together shouldn't they have uh defined roles as it were,1,0
sw2182B-ms98-a,11,B,100.72475,106.49725,5.7725,and then they got into everybody has to have a career and it seems to be going back to,1,0
sw2182B-ms98-a,12,B,106.49725,118.25325,11.756,a lot of women wanting to stay home with their kids although i don't think it'll ever go back to the way it used to be there will still be many many women who seek careers uh before they seek family,2,0
sw2182B-ms98-a,40,B,312.495125,321.4865,8.991375,you know i guess science will eventually have all the answers to everything i don't know but it seems like it it would really be,1,0
sw2182B-ms98-a,43,B,337.323625,350.638,13.314375,you know even between a same sexes in a different in the same role there would there would be differences in the way one guy handled something over the way another guy would handle it so i- i think when you put a male and a female in,1,0
sw2182B-ms98-a,44,B,350.638,358.33075,7.69275,in and when in comparison you know it would be uh completely different i mean just just totally different,1,0
sw2182B-ms98-a,45,B,358.33075,372.08475,13.754,and it you know goes a lot of it goes back to the way you were raised as children you know the males are raised to believe this and be this way and the females are raised to believe something else and be this way,2,0
sw2182B-ms98-a,76,B,542.3205,553.353875,11.033375,and uh what they're willing to do and so i feel like it you know that men have gotten to be that way too they've gotten a little bit more relaxed in their thinking about,1,0
sw2182B-ms98-a,79,B,567.811625,573.49475,5.683125,there are still people who men who believe that women should be home you know all day,1,0
sw2184A-ms98-a,61,A,245.667375,248.881125,3.21375,yeah wouldn't that be awful if you were,1,0

sw2184B-ms98-a,84,B,349.276125,359.248125,9.972,you know that's really that's really frightening so i think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know ,1,0
sw2185B-ms98-a,19,B,106.689625,115.893875,9.20425,and we put a flat over the top and everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see  it seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint,1,0
sw2185B-ms98-a,23,B,140.175375,150.33525,10.159875,we we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the since the first  we  a lot of time on the floor with a tooth toothbrush and what not cleaning up ,1,0
sw2185B-ms98-a,50,B,242.275375,250.9895,8.714125,took a lot of the hassle out and then they're we're not you know you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a granary or something like that as you would be with your own house,1,0
sw2185B-ms98-a,62,B,285.445,293.952625,8.507625,we're they'll be there for a while we're we're pretty comfortable with that but yeah it it i'm i'm real nervous every time i i open a new can i'm wondering if i shouldn't,1,0
sw2186A-ms98-a,33,A,194.141125,199.75375,5.612625,uh they would probably be at a disadvantage losing possibility of losing their uh their assets or wealth,1,0
sw2186B-ms98-a,6,B,22.187375,33.18325,10.995875,well see i have mixed feelings because um it it the with the financial situation i don't really quite understand what would happen there if they would be a burden to us,1,0
sw2186B-ms98-a,30,B,141.182375,143.17025,1.987875,they're supposed to be bilingual,1,0
sw2186B-ms98-a,35,B,170.7415,179.4255,8.684,yeah i think if i was a middle class Puerto Rican maybe that that would be the um stablest thing to do,1,0
sw2186B-ms98-a,45,B,215.99925,224.318125,8.318875,um rallies and people would be in the streets flashing signs statehood yes and other people would s- down the statehood,1,0
sw2186B-ms98-a,77,B,392.008375,396.027375,4.019,they they would probably stay commonwealth or that would be the best for them,1,0
sw2186B-ms98-a,82,B,419.823625,427.57875,7.755125,um so uh you like i say i was reading this ten years ago whether they could they're going to be talking about this in another ten years,1,0
sw2186B-ms98-a,99,B,482.164,492.91875,10.75475,it could be i'm sure they rely heavily on tourism and even  the all the American companies down there with their uh electronics industries and pharmaceuticals are big down there ,1,0
sw2186B-ms98-a,100,B,492.91875,501.485,8.56625,that's one thing i did notice uh pharmaceuticals electronics tha- makes up i mean enough to be like eight or ten percent of their business,1,0
sw2186B-ms98-a,102,B,514.35175,517.738,3.38625,agriculturally i found that to be really odd,1,0
sw2187A-ms98-a,10,A,63.989,72.15575,8.16675, for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp cheddar and then i was going to make other things like potato skins ,1,0
sw2187A-ms98-a,46,A,299.679,312.766,13.087,yeah they're real neat i think they're real reasonably priced some of them they used to be a hundred dollars and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert but i didn't get that one i got the Black and Decker kind but uh,1,0
sw2187A-ms98-a,70,A,483.431875,494.608125,11.17625,and beat it good it seems to be better than putting the the cornstarch into the liquid it once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top,1,0
sw2187A-ms98-a,79,A,559.956375,573.469875,13.5135,and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap so when you pull the Saran Wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap and i might put it back on but um,1,0
sw2187B-ms98-a,30,B,149.827375,163.717,13.889625,oh i think it would it would be a lot of work but um you know because it's you know you have to cut each thing or you know use the melon baler and stuff but but i think they're really neat and you know i think they're worth the time,1,0
sw2187B-ms98-a,41,B,215.997375,227.482625,11.48525,oh well that's good because i know they've been really expensive lately  because they weren't in season of course they had to be be uh grown in greenhouses and stuff and in  ,2,0
sw2187B-ms98-a,84,B,459.71525,464.97275,5.2575,it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good,1,0
sw2189A-ms98-a,4,A,23.943375,29.719,5.775625,so they're saying now that Bo knows arthritis and it could be actually a career ending injury,1,0
sw2189A-ms98-a,11,A,65.142,67.57675,2.43475,i wouldn't be surprised whatsoever,1,0
sw2189A-ms98-a,24,A,108.28225,115.669625,7.387375,a very sports intensive evening it seems to be on TV about the business of college athletics,1,0
sw2189B-ms98-a,38,B,235.666,239.783625,4.117625,you don't thin- yeah i don't know if it would be dishonest or honest though ,1,0
sw2190A-ms98-a,7,A,37.436375,45.8745,8.438125,would be the the Freons i mean for air cond- the one i guess that's the one i'm most curious about is how they're going to replace the Freons in air-conditioning,1,0
sw2190A-ms98-a,8,A,45.8745,55.479375,9.604875,that seemed to be the biggest surprise to me and whether when they replace it you know they're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad,1,0
sw2190A-ms98-a,10,A,62.78875,67.737875,4.949125,yeah yeah i uh was uh you know where they were all concerned about that but that that it seems to be,1,0
sw2190A-ms98-a,61,A,302.501625,310.238375,7.73675,uh it i guess it's got to be really i don't know i don't know if it's air pollution it's uh it's dust pollution whether it's natural or not i don't know,1,0
sw2190A-ms98-a,65,A,333.335625,341.410875,8.07525,well i know it it's uh you know the car is we have this big romance with the car but uh i think people are would be interested if you had one i mean,1,0
sw2190A-ms98-a,84,A,435.73575,441.445,5.70925,yeah i- i think uh there could be a lot of peo- i thi- people close this is really we're,1,0
sw2190B-ms98-a,16,B,111.863125,117.840375,5.97725,and it's it's going to be interesting to see if Carl Sagan and his billions and billions of stars may have once made a mistake but,1,0
sw2190B-ms98-a,48,B,282.39275,288.640625,6.247875,i can be a little sympathetic but you know there's some argument that in in in the blue grass of Kentucky that the Smoky Mountains,1,0
sw2191A-ms98-a,11,A,48.60275,51.226375,2.623625, oh no that can be awful,1,0
sw2193A-ms98-a,29,A,69.834625,73.846,4.011375,right right and who wants to be treated which way,1,0
sw2193A-ms98-a,46,A,126.93975,132.728875,5.789125,you know if that's what interests them and they think you know they can handle it i think they ought to be able to do it,1,0
sw2193A-ms98-a,51,A,146.524,151.00225,4.47825,you know for a long time they thought stuff like that you know trying to be firemen policemen,1,0
sw2193A-ms98-a,52,A,151.00225,154.087,3.08475,and stuff like that now they get to be all that,1,0
sw2193A-ms98-a,58,A,169.64325,177.40475,7.7615,right you're uh you know it's the best person qualified i think and and that's the way it ought to be but it's as we know it's not,1,0
sw2193A-ms98-a,99,A,331.990125,342.379625,10.3895,but i don't know it just it just kind of bothers me and that that just may be because we're not used to having i'm not used to having women in in roles like that you know as role models,1,0
sw2193A-ms98-a,129,A,423.50475,432.627,9.12225,so that's going to be interesting to see how that kind of stuff does play into it because_1 a lot of times you know you do look at the men and they never seem to show any emotion they just,1,0
sw2193A-ms98-a,154,A,494.626375,506.58575,11.959375,whatever these leaders of ours do that everything's for the good that just like like you said it's with man or a woman it sh- however they're going to be able to uh take care of us,1,0
sw2193A-ms98-a,173,A,582.2515,594.8225,12.571,yeah there's a lady here in uh Dallas who started a mozzarell- or a cheese company can't remember the name of it and she's a multimillionaire from it and i- i just think God if only it could be me  ,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,9,B,60.35025,71.00175,10.6515,strong uh you know women's libbers and others that don't want to be and it's it's confusing trying to figure out which one is which yeah you don't know whether to call Ms or Mrs you know,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,19,B,93.85525,99.426875,5.571625,although i did notice that all the ones who were saying women should have to be in combat were too old and fat to go,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,21,B,101.55875,115.728875,14.170125,now it's kind of like when the men do you course you you used to saying used to be the old men declare the war and the young men fight it and now and now it's it's i'm happy to see that the women have the same problem that the men has had because they got the old fat women yelling well yeah they ought to fight but course they don't have to go,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,25,B,132.517125,134.960625,2.4435,well they couldn't be worse than some of the men,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,29,B,154.006125,160.333125,6.327,well if i think if you know regardless of sex whether you can if you can handle the job then i think you should be able to do it,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,35,B,175.965625,182.6155,6.649875,yeah i- i stutter to think that i may be flying in a seven forty seven with a woman who got on the flight program because she happened to have the right you know,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,38,B,186.242125,192.468,6.225875,yeah that's true i hate to  hate to look up and find someone who was admitted to medical school simply because she happened to be a female,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,44,B,206.833125,211.098625,4.2655,whatever it's with the Black the Black problem or whatever that may be now,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,53,B,257.029375,262.51875,5.489375,what do you think about uh about our new governor since she happens to be a female,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,55,B,283.020125,293.85025,10.830125,i think i'm more scared of her not because she's a female but because more for her po-  her political beliefs and what she says she's going to do i think i'd be scared of anybody male or female in that position,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,62,B,341.085375,342.8015,1.716125,that could be yeah,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,73,B,376.460875,386.136125,9.67525,so i think you know i- i'm not sure whether she was elected because she was a female or be- or because she supported the gays i really don't know because a large you know there's a large population down there of gays,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,76,B,388.67025,394.17075,5.5005,yeah she seems to be interesting i- i and you see more and more uh you know uh Mickey Leland's wife is,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,85,B,441.4,450.982,9.582,course the reason yeah i think it's going to be harder for for females in the next ten years or so to make strides in say you know the Southwest and Midwest and you down here,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,86,B,450.982,452.927625,1.945625,in the southern states than it will be up,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,106,B,544.33825,551.641625,7.303375,i've noticed that in a lot of companies that you know everybody says well there's no women in upper management and my first question well is there anyone qualified to be there,1,0
sw2193B-ms98-a,107,B,551.641625,558.934375,7.29275,just because you happen to be a a female or a minority or anything else doesn't automatically mean y- it shouldn't mean that you get promoted to that part,1,0
sw2194A-ms98-a,21,A,86.5115,97.634375,11.122875,if if i started using a different computer at home then i wouldn't be using the the software and the hardware and it would be that much more difficult for me to try and market it the the product,2,0
sw2194A-ms98-a,64,A,359.373625,368.130875,8.75725,the the files may be disappearing but the secretaries are not the the people people in power are are afraid to give up that status symbol,1,0
sw2194A-ms98-a,67,A,386.929625,399.07775,12.148125,well i don't know like back in in my particular office there must be at least uh twenty twenty five people one secretary no typewriter it's all computers everybody's got a a PC sitting in front of their desk ,1,0
sw2194A-ms98-a,86,A,495.8825,502.451625,6.569125,secretaries actually had to be artists and  and technicians and today uh with the laser printer,1,0
sw2194A-ms98-a,87,A,502.451625,514.44,11.988375,they're uh really not being utilized as much as they had been in the past i'm making some really pretty foils that uh four or five years ago i wouldn't have ever dreamed i could be doing them and it's it's so easy to do uh,1,0
sw2194B-ms98-a,83,B,384.314625,388.134875,3.82025,there'd be a bunch of people staring at the typewriter with no idea what to do with it,1,0
sw2194B-ms98-a,91,B,419.18,433.62675,14.44675,huh because what i was what i was going to ask you is it seems like the next big jump will come with color printing you were talking about doing your own presentation and foils it would seem that color capability would be the next big sort of leap in presentation,1,0
sw2195A-ms98-a,7,A,21.14675,31.448,10.30125,you are uh sitting in on a jury trial where you might be acquainted with at least maybe not that person but part of their family,1,0
sw2195B-ms98-a,14,B,57.624625,63.879875,6.25525,give their uh input as to what they think need to be done and then maybe he can go from there,1,0
sw2195B-ms98-a,35,B,197.542875,204.766125,7.22325,no and i i couldn't believe they would do that so maybe in a way it should be left up to the judge because uh maybe the jury isn't,1,0
sw2195B-ms98-a,46,B,253.596625,262.6425,9.045875,he would be the sole factor uh determining a person's outcome i guess though but the jury still has their input and maybe he goes,1,0
sw2196A-ms98-a,4,A,9.167125,23.768875,14.60175,uh trying to find something that would would get us into the housing market as it were thinking that someday we'd move on uh the economy however changed that a little bit and looks like we're going to be in this home for a while but uh it's not too bad,1,0
sw2196A-ms98-a,23,A,194.840125,199.273625,4.4335,so it turned out to be pretty good and,1,0
sw2196A-ms98-a,75,A,491.2345,495.201375,3.966875,that'd be hard to hard to cover all the ones that go bad,1,0
sw2196A-ms98-a,81,A,503.902375,508.927,5.024625,yeah and it'd be nice to do it with with all the same kind ,1,0
sw2196A-ms98-a,89,A,526.817375,531.0775,4.260125,yeah that could be but once you get that moisture in there it,1,0
sw2196B-ms98-a,65,B,458.731875,472.966375,14.2345,w- we had um our insurance our home owner's insurance actually covered some of it because_1 i told them it looks like something's eating into the glass it turns like a milky white you know so i said well how do we know it wasn't some kind of chemical or something that's eating into that which would be covered under a glass rider so,1,0
sw2196B-ms98-a,76,B,500.502375,504.173875,3.6715,just about every window in our house i guess eventually is going to have to be replaced,1,0
sw2197A-ms98-a,13,A,41.622375,49.083125,7.46075,um-hum um-hum um-hum how do you feel about it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college how does that uh,1,0
sw2197A-ms98-a,35,A,137.960125,145.484625,7.5245,they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the  job they'd get after college so it's it's really kind of crazy,2,0
sw2197A-ms98-a,63,A,248.26525,250.628,2.36275,be fostered in as you become,1,0
sw2197A-ms98-a,65,A,256.621875,266.153,9.531125,and maybe the Air Force Academy is appropriate as you said for someone who you know a more you know who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them,1,0
sw2197A-ms98-a,132,A,563.88525,571.63775,7.7525,yeah and and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time,1,0
sw2197A-ms98-a,133,A,571.63775,578.04125,6.4035,so i'd say go to a go to a college that has teachers people who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job,1,0
sw2197B-ms98-a,20,B,81.180625,84.834625,3.654,be a big factor in your decision's just the the cost of,1,0
sw2197B-ms98-a,24,B,95.3805,98.501875,3.121375,probably going to be paying off or have been or,1,0
sw2197B-ms98-a,59,B,265.158375,271.212375,6.054,or it's also a good environment it may be good for someone who already has self-discipline who has a certain amount of,1,0
sw2198A-ms98-a,45,A,158.80375,161.46625,2.6625,yeah is that supposed to be something like that one,1,0
sw2198A-ms98-a,115,A,413.30975,416.982125,3.672375,but he's a good director so i mean he should still be able to,1,0
sw2198A-ms98-a,131,A,482.488625,485.983875,3.49525,i guess they wouldn't be called dialects but they're pretty close sometimes,1,0
sw2198B-ms98-a,31,B,130.2095,144.492625,14.283125,yeah it's a suspense well i guess it's ranked number one now it's supposed to be pretty good suspenseful yeah but are you good at do you like suspenseful movies like that yeah see because_1 i i'm not really one that likes real sus- i like the nice lighthearted comedies most of the time ,1,0
sw2198B-ms98-a,38,B,160.489875,173.51625,13.026375,yeah yeah something like that except it's it's supposed to be really you know suspenseful yeah so i guess but we're you know it's been rated pretty well and every all the critics like it so and every word of mouth has been pretty good on it so ,1,0
sw2198B-ms98-a,45,B,212.997375,222.69,9.692625,they said it's supposed to be really weird but because that David Lynch has like a weird style but i didn't think it was really weird you know not as weird as i don't know i we also,1,0
sw2198B-ms98-a,66,B,321.987,325.96375,3.97675,yeah so i think uh but i think it's supposed to be well done,1,0
sw2198B-ms98-a,82,B,437.983875,443.472625,5.48875,so that's uh because he has a pretty strong will and he directs his own way so it should be you know pretty good,1,0
sw2199A-ms98-a,22,A,89.825125,98.0385,8.213375,and growing maybe tomatoes or flowers like right now it would be beautiful in in Maryland you know daffodils are just all blooming so it would be really pretty,2,0
sw2199A-ms98-a,52,A,202.5575,210.058875,7.501375,by um well you might have some tomatoes still blooming in uh in October the begi- very be- first week of October,1,0
sw2199A-ms98-a,57,A,224.79325,228.12725,3.334,oh gee that'd be nice,1,0

sw2201A-ms98-a,12,A,47.670125,59.73325,12.063125,well that's true i- i agree that there should be something done about people that drink alcohol because i'm sure that there's people that drink and come to work especially on a second shift or third shift,1,0
sw2201A-ms98-a,59,A,311.01975,315.457375,4.437625,now see that i wouldn't agree with see see i think you got to be able to bend the rules a little bit,1,0
sw2201A-ms98-a,64,A,345.502875,349.39675,3.893875,so it seems like they should be able to bend  the rules oops excuse me a little bit,1,0
sw2201A-ms98-a,76,A,400.813375,409.43575,8.622375,and drugs are illegal so i guess if they made drugs legal or marijuana legal then we the we wouldn't be going through this,1,0
sw2201A-ms98-a,77,A,409.43575,411.479375,2.043625,you know they wouldn't be testing,1,0
sw2201A-ms98-a,102,A,531.399125,536.343,4.943875,you know and and i'm even afraid to be around it,1,0
sw2201A-ms98-a,106,A,549.70925,556.249625,6.540375, and with my luck there'd be the notice Monday you  go take your test and that would scare me ,1,0
sw2201B-ms98-a,21,B,75.107,81.475125,6.368125,you know you got reason to suspect they may be doing drugs and he says sure you know take them_1 down there and test them_1 but,1,0
sw2201B-ms98-a,34,B,136.64975,142.74575,6.096,but there's i think there's a there's a big difference between use and abuse and i d- do agree that drug abuse should be punished,1,0
sw2201B-ms98-a,37,B,151.074125,155.3655,4.291375,you know do it do some drugs then that should be their business,1,0

sw2202A-ms98-a,109,A,412.660625,421.50025,8.839625,and i would always be on the other end of two eighty five having to go all the way around two eighty five and then onto eighty five to go home and it was always at the end of the day,1,0
sw2202A-ms98-a,147,A,528.536,536.16525,7.62925,well you know i- i was when when the big boom was going on i was thinking well Dukakis must be an absolute genius,1,0
sw2202A-ms98-a,154,A,568.055625,572.39725,4.341625,you know good a good chief executive would be able to sit back and not do anything,1,0
sw2202B-ms98-a,74,B,221.355875,228.1365,6.780625,oh yeah i- i think that the commute to to and from work has to be the worst horror show,1,0
sw2203A-ms98-a,65,A,331.7205,339.580875,7.860375,yeah i i've been thinking about it  only problem is i- i would be very limited in any job opportunities out there,1,0
sw2203B-ms98-a,6,B,22.779125,33.49725,10.718125,uh well we just planted the plum tree this year so we haven't uh haven't gotten anything off of that hopefully this will be the first year for our peaches we're hoping to get something off of that so,1,0
sw2203B-ms98-a,46,B,172.7355,176.34325,3.60775,that's right you you know that could be worth ten thousand dollars so,1,0
sw2203B-ms98-a,55,B,215.998375,223.49625,7.497875,uh-huh oh my husband just has to have it green has to be green it's,1,0
sw2203B-ms98-a,95,B,337.492375,344.508125,7.01575,yeah that's that's it we'd like to be closer to family but limits the job your welcome Brittany,1,0
sw2203B-ms98-a,128,B,450.25,455.49275,5.24275,yeah yeah they couldn't even be in the house because they had no power and everything,1,0
sw2203B-ms98-a,157,B,564.976375,570.262,5.285625,yeah yeah you have to be so careful when you buy at the stores,1,0
sw2204A-ms98-a,5,A,18.759375,27.373125,8.61375,uh finding that there tend to be people in the jury that can't bring themselves to sentence someone,1,0
sw2204A-ms98-a,25,A,158.381,163.782125,5.401125,and there were twenty three unsolved murders and nobody seem to be concerned about it ,1,0
sw2204A-ms98-a,36,A,261.632375,275.752125,14.11975,uh but uh asking questions during the trial my experience as a juror uh well it was a traffic situation uh there were three points of law that had to be made,1,0
sw2204B-ms98-a,6,B,39.1025,51.994,12.8915,and uh in each case it was a retrial and the sentencing was the same each time which happened in the state of Florida happened to be uh death,1,0
sw2204B-ms98-a,9,B,66.780125,71.967375,5.18725,depending on uh in certain crimes i think that they should be mandatory,1,0
sw2204B-ms98-a,11,B,75.167,82.50075,7.33375,uh if we have convicted i think uh plea bargaining should should be uh a thing of the past,1,0
sw2204B-ms98-a,32,B,174.518,181.721875,7.203875,well in answer to you know answer to the question though i still think the sentencing should be in the hands of the jury even though as you say there are some,1,0
sw2204B-ms98-a,71,B,343.83025,347.504,3.67375,i will and which will probably be the uh Monday as a matter of fact ,1,0
sw2205A-ms98-a,49,A,316.99875,325.7255,8.72675,are seem to be like White Anglo Saxon  type people and they all seem to be you know fairly similar and i kind of prefer,2,0
sw2205A-ms98-a,50,A,325.7255,336.241625,10.516125,a you know some females i don't recall that they have any female anchors and i like different i like the anchors to be different kinds of people,1,0
sw2205A-ms98-a,65,A,399.981,410.83125,10.85025,well we you know like  all of the stations seem to be pretty good it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into Houston so we had a,1,0
sw2205B-ms98-a,34,B,266.9795,279.18925,12.20975,well i watch channel five but that has to be that's another bias that has to do with the weather reporting i'm not sure that actually i think channel eight is probably but i know Dave Fox he goes to our church so,1,0
sw2205B-ms98-a,43,B,368.5905,377.99975,9.40925,totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs but i think that uh in some cases the- there should be some real opportunity and and some diversity and,1,0
sw2206A-ms98-a,36,A,166.983875,171.812375,4.8285,i don't know what kind of a summer we're expecting this year i imagine it's going to be hot again,1,0
sw2206A-ms98-a,42,A,184.980625,195.2835,10.302875,i don't guess it's going to be any much different uh than than it has been in the past so i expect uh July and August we'll see our  or uh share of hundred degree days,1,0
sw2206A-ms98-a,97,A,392.5035,395.20125,2.69775,it's i think it's supposed to be nice though,1,0
sw2206A-ms98-a,119,A,503.94075,514.952625,11.011875,i don't know but uh yeah i guess next week's supposed to be real nice outside i hope it is anyway because uh softball season starts and we're ready t- to go outside and do some outdoor activities,1,0
sw2206A-ms98-a,125,A,531.81525,534.499125,2.683875,i can only guess that it's supposed to be nice,1,0
sw2206B-ms98-a,38,B,149.32725,156.998875,7.671625,well at least you can plan you can say well uh i'm going to go to the beach next Wednesday and you'll know that it's going to be hot enough to go,1,0
sw2206B-ms98-a,39,B,156.998875,165.8165,8.817625,but i- in New York you really never know you can plan  t- you know to go up to the beach on the Fourth of July and then you know it might be seventy degrees or something,1,0
sw2206B-ms98-a,52,B,207.4895,215.756875,8.267375,uh that's supposed to be really cold weather in the winter that's why New York gets so cold because_1 it's so close to Canada,1,0
sw2220A-ms98-a,69,A,419.692125,430.739625,11.0475,that'd probably be pretty interesting i was summoned down to the courthouse last week they had summoned eight hundred people about four hundred showed up and it was for a murder trial,1,0
sw2220A-ms98-a,78,A,503.32525,513.670875,10.345625,th- the investigator yeah he he got off right away and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that so i figure that that will make me biased and i won't be chosen,1,0
sw2220A-ms98-a,85,A,545.61,555.737125,10.127125,no i said that i could i could believe in it in certain instances but i would be i'd find it hard to levy that against somebody,1,0
sw2220B-ms98-a,22,B,88.468625,96.248625,7.78,yeah it must be fun to be able to play it and you know if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be,3,0
sw2220B-ms98-a,23,B,96.248625,98.4545,2.205875,that'd be kind of fun i think,1,0
sw2220B-ms98-a,80,B,403.49,417.6665,14.1765,no no i- uh no i don't go to East Texas uh i got a degree from TWU but i'm really interested in legal  you know in the legal environment but i don't want to be a  so i said well i think i'll go back to school and ,1,0
sw2220B-ms98-a,94,B,513.742375,526.20975,12.467375,well not necessarily but there's probably something else that might make you because_1 you could know about you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for jur- the jury,2,0
sw2220B-ms98-a,96,B,534.425875,548.696125,14.27025,th- they might weed you out some other way you know if you if you don't believe like if this was a capital crime an- and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty you're not going to be picked at all so but,1,0
sw2221A-ms98-a,19,A,68.478625,81.995,13.516375,well i think the six is called a Grand Jury and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial or it's whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused of,1,0
sw2221A-ms98-a,22,A,94.46725,102.998125,8.530875,yeah i don't know i- i think that uh i know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked however,1,0
sw2221A-ms98-a,24,A,103.981875,118.303125,14.32125,yeah it seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it y- give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong,1,0
sw2221A-ms98-a,25,A,118.303125,130.25925,11.956125,or for you know if if if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off at much easier than twelve people could,1,0
sw2221A-ms98-a,31,A,170.792375,181.496875,10.7045,someone could be sentenced to thirty five years and yet you know th- the parole system uh it's going to let them out in in three years for good behavior,1,0
sw2221A-ms98-a,48,A,243.7755,256.773375,12.997875,like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor and they are not allowed i mean th- some of them are even allowed to work they can go to their regular job they come home they have to be home by such and such a time,1,0
sw2221A-ms98-a,54,A,286.581,301.45725,14.87625,so that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they're supposed to be doing and that's working rather well that's a good system that allows people to actually continue to be productive members of society while,2,0
sw2221A-ms98-a,65,A,338.66125,346.958875,8.297625,that they should i and this may sound cruel but i do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes,1,0
sw2221A-ms98-a,82,A,433.498375,442.71125,9.212875,to start like a couple of thousand dollars but there should be a limit over which they that it all goes back to the State anything that they've earned while they're in prison,1,0
sw2221A-ms98-a,83,A,442.71125,450.742875,8.031625,should go back to the State except for that you know there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with,1,0
sw2221A-ms98-a,112,A,580.4855,588.452375,7.966875,it might be more it m- would be more work for the jury but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it,3,0
sw2221B-ms98-a,5,B,25.326625,32.497875,7.17125,to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people like the juries that i've served on are businessmen,1,0
sw2221B-ms98-a,7,B,37.996,51.7425,13.7465,okay they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars all the time so you know i think that it a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket someone that you know you can't really do it ,1,0
sw2221B-ms98-a,21,B,129.28375,134.98875,5.705,yeah would be pretty hard well i don't think you know i don't think that,1,0
sw2221B-ms98-a,22,B,134.98875,144.478625,9.489875,if i was the criminal that i would like the judge passing sentence on me if the jury found me guilty then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be,2,0
sw2221B-ms98-a,56,B,307.296375,315.765875,8.4695,and that way it would give you know the probation department and parole department they've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in in Lubbock,1,0
sw2221B-ms98-a,85,B,449.483125,454.30125,4.818125,yeah but at least they would at least that way they would be helping pay for their own,1,0
sw2221B-ms98-a,104,B,547.496625,559.99825,12.501625,well they have a stronger debate too because there's twelve people there they have to decide whether or not he's guilty and then they can sit in th- at the same time and decide what his punishment would be and you'd have more than one person's input on it,1,0
sw2221B-ms98-a,106,B,561.245375,569.74975,8.504375,and you know we're supposed to be and i quote in a democratic society so you know if you can find me guilty then you ought to be able to pass sentence,2,0
sw2221B-ms98-a,110,B,585.49,593.827,8.337,yeah it would uh s- yeah serving on the jury would be definitely more respo- you'd have to be a definitely more responsible person,2,0
sw2222B-ms98-a,3,B,3.671125,9.270875,5.59975,well i uh i'd have to say my favorite team would be Cincinnati Bengals,1,0
sw2222B-ms98-a,38,B,119.98325,123.784875,3.801625,yeah what time is that supposed to be,1,0
sw2222B-ms98-a,45,B,149.841125,157.384125,7.543,yeah yeah and uh it just seems like it should only be done in cold ,1,0
sw2222B-ms98-a,46,B,157.384125,161.489875,4.10575,rather than just be played at a- anytime during the year,1,0
sw2222B-ms98-a,89,B,331.229625,335.732,4.502375,yeah right right most people seem to be there out there,1,0
sw2223A-ms98-a,26,A,164.4955,177.34025,12.84475,well kids used to have a respect for the teacher i guess at one time but i think we've kind of lost that in out school system and i'm not really sure how to get it back i say discipline and that might be the wrong choice of words but it,1,0
sw2223A-ms98-a,36,A,254.714625,258.419625,3.705,in the long run i think it would really be worth while ,1,0
sw2223B-ms98-a,22,B,175.65475,185.247375,9.592625,i know um i know with um i think teachers need to be paid more i have a lot of friends who and myself who've thought about,1,0
sw2224A-ms98-a,5,A,17.7485,23.172,5.4235,yeah uh i'm surprised being that being from Dallas i thought you'd be a Dallas fan,1,0
sw2224A-ms98-a,40,A,160.46275,164.133375,3.670625,no i don't think they'll be able to carry it that far uh,1,0
sw2224A-ms98-a,42,A,165.655,174.714125,9.059125,who who would you if you had your pick out of anyone of the league teams who would you say is going to be the new new uh Super Bowl champions this year for ninety one,1,0
sw2224A-ms98-a,46,A,188.27875,197.8495,9.57075,i thought i thought for sure that Buffalo was going to be in there this past year i really did and i w- that would be my choice that would be my choice again this year,3,0
sw2224A-ms98-a,76,A,336.594875,349.49275,12.897875,that that would be and the other thing is they're going to be there in that same position one of these days you know and hopefully they like Bo Jackson now as i understand has hurt himself in both baseball and football he he's there's question as to whether he's going to come back i haven't read today's paper,2,0
sw2224A-ms98-a,89,A,429.20725,435.40825,6.201,may be a real problem but i- i would think that football would have been more of a detriment to him than than baseball would,1,0
sw2224A-ms98-a,95,A,474.533,476.755125,2.222125,he would be on par with,1,0
sw2224A-ms98-a,101,A,499.757125,509.5445,9.787375,no i don't believe so i don't believe he's going to be able to get the job done in Denver he's going to run up some big numbers and stuff but i don't believe he's going to get the job done there because Den- simply because Denver is not not the,1,0
sw2224A-ms98-a,104,A,520.93575,523.551375,2.615625,yeah that's that could be true too,1,0

sw2242A-ms98-a,64,A,348.13575,359.282125,11.146375,it's uh it just adds about twenty miles to it but it's worth it to get to the campground and be just be out in the country and the woods all by yourself or you know with just a few neighbors around or so,2,0
sw2242A-ms98-a,69,A,373.7905,379.069125,5.278625,i'll be looking forward to to like i say with a Winnebago because as the older you get the less things you want to do,1,0

sw2246A-ms98-a,60,A,355.34175,368.52475,13.183,i don't really have a good solution for the budget thing either except for that um i know that they're trying to be they're that they're supposedly trying to be fair with taxes and by making it more equal,2,0
sw2246A-ms98-a,63,A,373.932125,381.295875,7.36375,um it has to be the same percentage where you have someone that makes,1,0

sw2246B-ms98-a,5,B,20.468375,32.605875,12.1375,well it has to be done somewhat arbitrarily at uh on in some uh instances i think that um goods should cost um real total costs rather than just manufacturing costs ,1,0
sw2246B-ms98-a,6,B,32.605875,46.200375,13.5945,and that means uh if you oh produce something that creates uh uh adverse health effects that should somehow be reflected in the product if you uh the cost of,1,0

sw2249A-ms98-a,27,A,174.155625,181.88925,7.733625,so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade and it's really going to be,1,0
sw2249A-ms98-a,31,A,208.00125,217.836625,9.835375,and then you put all your  yard clippings and uh leaf rakings and anything that will be {compostible},1,0
sw2249A-ms98-a,50,A,317.94425,324.622625,6.678375,yeah well we can get a nickel a piece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused,1,0
sw2249A-ms98-a,72,A,417.311625,424.22825,6.916625,uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse it would have to be cut into four foot lengths,1,0
sw2249A-ms98-a,73,A,424.22825,433.680375,9.452125,so you know if we have branches or something they have to be cut in four foot lengths but otherwise uh they have to be in one of their paper bags,2,0
sw2249A-ms98-a,80,A,469.156,474.72,5.564,but i that's not going to be a regular feature that was just a one time thing right after Christmas,1,0
sw2249A-ms98-a,101,A,581.276375,590.704875,9.4285,well let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because,1,0
sw2249B-ms98-a,104,B,474.182125,478.031625,3.8495,well the but uh something nee- does need to be done about the styrofoam,1,0
sw2249B-ms98-a,112,B,497.35,503.833125,6.483125,and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that and i think that would be great if they could get something organized,1,0
sw2249B-ms98-a,133,B,595.1325,599.0825,3.95,and so it'll it'll be good in the long run well i enjoyed it,1,0
sw2250A-ms98-a,41,A,165.4815,176.938125,11.456625,right so uh for a health insurance what do you think would be a uh a good health insurance with a a low deductible and a high premium or do you prefer the lower premiums with a higher deductible,1,0
sw2250B-ms98-a,42,B,194.05525,200.368,6.31275,uh i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage,1,0
sw2250B-ms98-a,46,B,211.101,220.98025,9.87925,you don't drop into a hospital and demand you know a thousand dollars worth of tests you know or you think you need to be hospitalized but there's only a certain i mean you can go anywhere you want to go ,1,0
sw2250B-ms98-a,50,B,239.650125,244.799625,5.1495,to doctors but they have since dropped that i guess it got to be you know not cost effective,1,0
sw2250B-ms98-a,51,B,244.799625,258.5355,13.735875,right so they have dropped the uh second opinion type thing but before you uh allow yourself to be admitted to the hospital you really there's a telephone number that you have to call you know and they will tell you exactly you know what they will pay for it,1,0
sw2250B-ms98-a,59,B,291.3315,300.01275,8.68125,but i would really check that out because_1 i'm concerned in coming years it's going to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger folks,1,0
sw2251A-ms98-a,12,A,100.92,106.583,5.663,i don't know i mean i guess if there if it was more people it would be better if it was just like you know the majority,1,0
sw2251A-ms98-a,53,A,262.74675,264.738375,1.991625,oh that would be really tough,1,0
sw2251B-ms98-a,3,B,6.475125,20.799375,14.32425,i don't know if i'd be willing to accept the um abuses that would come along with that and that the it'd be relatively easy to get some bad decisions or to even get to the judge from a standpoint of bribery but ,2,0
sw2251B-ms98-a,9,B,69.554375,82.29975,12.745375,um what do you think about the aspect of unanimous jury when they do have a jury must all six or twelve uh agree before the the topic be final or or the verdict be final,2,0
sw2251B-ms98-a,12,B,124.422,137.349875,12.927875,then is it reasonable or is it or could you assume that there must be some reason for that person to be holding out and obviously the other eleven or five cannot convince this person,2,0
sw2251B-ms98-a,16,B,147.82925,152.348875,4.519625,farthest uh safeguard that can be done and uh,1,0

sw2267B-ms98-a,18,B,80.60025,90.40625,9.806,so it's it's a real messy subject it it i- it's there's just doesn't seem to be any good solution even though i do think that the uh,1,0
sw2267B-ms98-a,30,B,151.15075,154.4925,3.34175,i mean it may be no it was the number one crime,1,0
sw2267B-ms98-a,88,B,344.218375,352.35025,8.131875,ouch well yeah and a situation like that you know your your reflexes aren't good your senses aren't good i'd be,1,0
sw2268A-ms98-a,26,A,124.08,129.914125,5.834125,if it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places they hold tournaments there and everything,1,0
sw2268A-ms98-a,39,A,202.587625,205.355375,2.76775,i- i would be impressed    ,1,0
sw2268A-ms98-a,70,A,291.025875,297.185875,6.16,it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down it would be in that region,1,0
sw2268A-ms98-a,112,A,444.37625,445.848125,1.471875,maybe i'll be so lucky,1,0
sw2268B-ms98-a,7,B,25.177625,33.9455,8.767875,because you get i get sea sick  but one of these days i'm go- hoping they'll have some kind of medicine so i can go out and go uh deep sea fishing now that would be nice,1,0
sw2268B-ms98-a,36,B,121.7765,125.338875,3.562375,i you know that may be it that may be it and it,2,0
sw2268B-ms98-a,43,B,142.511875,146.517,4.005125,and i was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing and uh,1,0
sw2269A-ms98-a,5,A,33.064,47.176,14.112,uh ski boats and whatever else may be around some people uh  they they still call that a camp so i guess you could go camping and do archery and riflery and all the things that kids do at those camps but then go to their little ho- air conditioning room at night,1,0
sw2269A-ms98-a,12,A,101.3485,114.013625,12.665125,and you just never can time those things right with the water the way you would like them to be uh we got there and the water was really low we we ended up carrying the canoes over portions and,1,0
sw2269A-ms98-a,35,A,282.402,297.014875,14.612875,uh extreme south part where there's some some things worth seeing by foot uh the majority of of camping experiences around here seem to be geared toward entertainment where you're you're looking at the state parks all seem to have something of a,1,0
sw2269A-ms98-a,50,A,409.24675,418.995625,9.748875,yeah that would be one of my very first experiences of uh tent camping if it were with a group of people we went up to a state park that was,1,0
sw2269B-ms98-a,26,B,204.0165,209.46575,5.44925,though i guess a bread and breakfast or something might be a suggestion for you if you like the air condition type,1,0
sw2269B-ms98-a,58,B,374.716125,382.05825,7.342125,you know put seventy or ninety pounds on their back and go hiking uh  but uh it can be a lot of fun,1,0
sw2270A-ms98-a,39,A,131.407125,138.445,7.037875,occasionally you'll find one that's you know some of the friends will be talking about them_1 that you wished that you'd seen them_1   you could talk about them sooner but uh,1,0
sw2270A-ms98-a,53,A,171.301375,177.03275,5.731375,and we don't find a lot of those uh you know they'll be running uh four to six of those on a weekend,1,0
sw2270A-ms98-a,54,A,177.03275,185.175375,8.142625,and you know two weekends three weekends out of four maybe two or th- two out of three or three out of four there won't be anything that we want to go see,1,0
sw2270A-ms98-a,69,A,268.342375,277.7585,9.416125,so you if you knew what was going on you could kind of anticipate what was going to be said so i- i had a little bit advantage there over my wife she had not read the book ,1,0
sw2270B-ms98-a,16,B,43.015125,49.153125,6.138,uh this is going to be i've seen a lot of video lot of lot of video VCR stuff um ,1,0
sw2270B-ms98-a,62,B,224.707,229.06925,4.36225,ooh my it's got to be something fun yeah you don't have to think yeah sure ,1,0
sw2271A-ms98-a,60,A,174.65025,177.4245,2.77425,Duke'll be mighty mad though ,1,0
sw2271B-ms98-a,10,B,37.292,42.24,4.948,well U- they say UNLV may be the greatest amateur team ever,1,0
sw2271B-ms98-a,48,B,208.772875,212.614,3.841125,because_1 they figured everybody else is just coming to just to be there,1,0
sw2271B-ms98-a,50,B,217.20225,222.3205,5.11825,yeah i- i don't know that any one team's gonna be able to dominate for that many years in a row,1,0
sw2272A-ms98-a,9,A,59.154875,67.26375,8.108875,that's a big chunk out of someone's life uh certainly you know there could be advantages and things to be learned ,2,0
sw2272A-ms98-a,24,A,133.898125,137.99075,4.092625,uh you know it could be an advantage to them,1,0
sw2272A-ms98-a,29,A,167.086875,178.9415,11.854625,well and probably too even those who might initially be opposed once they got into it then they you know would see that hey this,1,0
sw2272A-ms98-a,52,A,300.7695,312.793,12.0235,you know be a a bad thing to take a couple years out of beginning you know their life in that respect they might you know get off on some other track but you know it's hard to say,1,0
sw2272A-ms98-a,74,A,418.908625,425.224625,6.316,it might not make the other person feel    really wanting to be there yeah,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,3,B,5.400375,19.5055,14.105125,personally i guess my my initial feeling is that i- it would be a great experience for kids um i- i don't think that they really get that sort of experience working with the community,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,6,B,27.71675,42.17875,14.462,i think it would be a great way to keep kids busy so that the- you know they they don't get on the wrong track um you know so that they they have someplace to go after school and they feel like they're producing um,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,7,B,42.17875,48.999625,6.820875,i mean who knows what they may be doing in their free time if they don't participate in something like this you know,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,21,B,85.63725,92.297625,6.660375,i guess a year is a long time maybe six months might be a little bit more reasonable,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,34,B,137.877875,141.231375,3.3535,i think it would be nice if they could,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,36,B,144.248375,152.31875,8.070375,you know um have it be just like real life teaching in a sense and maybe then uh,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,37,B,152.31875,167.19975,14.881,people are feeling like they're getting something out of it too but that certainly everyone else would be getting something out of them participating and and i mean i i even think that that sort of experience is worth a lot more than reading a textbook sometimes,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,49,B,216.954875,225.21675,8.261875,you know someone else might be relying on them for something um you know depending on them to either be somewhere or take someone someplace or something like that,2,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,50,B,225.21675,232.907375,7.690625,you know that that you really learn to to be dependable you know you learn that when someone's relying on you you need to be there,2,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,54,B,239.066625,247.51375,8.447125,well i- i work at a in a personnel agency and um i've just found the work ethics of people to be disgusting,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,58,B,264.151375,273.17275,9.021375,but um i mean perhaps that this sort of training early in life before people develop bad habits might not be such a bad idea but,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,59,B,273.17275,281.529375,8.356625,but you know it is it is a commitment and perhaps these people would rather be doing something else just as constructive and we're making them do that,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,76,B,351.70325,359.280875,7.577625,and i think it's getting the wrong sort of uh um connotation with it it shouldn't be looked at as a punishment,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,77,B,359.280875,363.05725,3.776375,it shouldn't be looked at something to do to make up for other things that you did,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,78,B,363.05725,368.624875,5.567625,i- i think it needs to be community service needs to have more of a positive,1,0
sw2272B-ms98-a,81,B,387.0215,401.7485,14.727,i i wouldn't want it i wouldn't want to be one of those people that's being taken care of somehow knowing that this person is doing it to get out of a sentence or or you know because they were bad in some other way,1,0
sw2273A-ms98-a,39,A,252.72425,267.285,14.56075,yeah hey you know and the and the kids used to enjoy that as well and i like children in fact uh one of the things that i notice a dramatic change was that that uh like if i'd be in a supermarket and i'd see a cute little kid  i wouldn't think twice about patting the kid on the head,1,0
sw2273A-ms98-a,55,A,360.127,373.57975,13.45275,that they would like to do and it would always be the things that i wanted to do without realizing it you know things like uh you know fishing and and doing out- things outside and my daughter didn't like doing those things so she ended up spending more time with her mother than uh,1,0
sw2273A-ms98-a,61,A,401.9585,415.901875,13.943375,um i spent a lot of time with her when i was home uh she'd always be the one you know sitting on my lap or being close to me and the two guys would be off uh uh playing someplace but it seems like whenever i wanted to do something like go out  for the kids,2,0
sw2273A-ms98-a,71,A,471.68675,478.619375,6.932625,yeah i think you force it on them  and and the youngest one tends to be the one that's spoiled,1,0
sw2273B-ms98-a,9,B,39.938875,47.821875,7.883,well he's yeah he's been gone for about_1 seven months now we're expecting him to be getting home here before too much longer hopefully ,1,0
sw2273B-ms98-a,24,B,118.5415,121.90175,3.36025, it can be pretty sudden too,1,0
sw2273B-ms98-a,39,B,194.15,203.52175,9.37175,that may be the difference in our part of the country we live in it's a lot easier to get out outside all year round uh well pretty near all year round out here,1,0
sw2273B-ms98-a,99,B,465.21625,472.655,7.43875,you know it's uh you know the older kid is uh is more always more prone to be more like responsible and that kind of thing,1,0
sw2273B-ms98-a,113,B,522.272875,526.038,3.765125,be ready to cry or whatever ,1,0
sw2274A-ms98-a,5,A,19.744375,29.646625,9.90225,it's not anything that seems to be um you know costing everybody a lot of money it's not a major topic of conversation it's just something that's done and accepted,1,0
sw2274A-ms98-a,34,A,134.8925,149.539875,14.647375,oh i know i know oh yeah it's true and i don't think that that burden should be put on companies either i don't think that they should have to assume the responsibility of paying for the person's health care,1,0
sw2274A-ms98-a,73,A,340.2215,345.90225,5.68075,i don't know but um it would be great and and if only i mean,1,0
sw2274A-ms98-a,74,A,345.90225,358.043125,12.140875,health is probably the one thing that people should be most concerned with you know espec- that makes a good society when people are healthy and they're not you know they're not stealing for money to pay for their doctors' bills,1,0
sw2274A-ms98-a,75,A,358.043125,366.50325,8.460125,you know they're they're going to work every day because they're not sick you know i mean just something that should be more of a priority than it is now,1,0
sw2274B-ms98-a,14,B,49.781875,62.896625,13.11475,well i feel like something needs to be done here and i'm definitely in favor of the government i just think me- you know medical costs have as i've seen over the years just go up and up and up and already just this year,1,0
sw2274B-ms98-a,72,B,393.05525,402.905625,9.850375,i- i don't know it's going to be hard to switch i think that we're going eventually end up end up that way though i just don't see how we can yeah i think it'll take,1,0
sw2274B-ms98-a,73,B,402.905625,407.097,4.191375,i agree it'll take a while but i think we have to be headed,1,0
sw2274B-ms98-a,74,B,407.097,409.489,2.392,have to be headed in that direction,1,0
sw2275A-ms98-a,6,A,34.193,41.78175,7.58875,it's it's nothing serious about it at all so i don't know why the two of them_1 happen to be my two favorite shows but they that's the way it is so,1,0
sw2275A-ms98-a,54,A,245.24175,254.522375,9.280625,which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners you know and that that i kind of thought was good but um,2,0
sw2275A-ms98-a,66,A,321.112625,333.742,12.629375,yeah the i- i- it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married you know the minute they get married everything's supposed to be cut and dried and,1,0
sw2275A-ms98-a,69,A,347.548625,357.170125,9.6215,couple of examples would be um well like i said this one about uh Max or Get Well Smart uh the female character uh Barbara Feldon,1,0
sw2275A-ms98-a,104,A,468.134875,470.564125,2.42925,yeah it's it wouldn't be easy,1,0
sw2276A-ms98-a,34,A,180.566375,183.74875,3.182375,be- because by ten thirty i start to fade,1,0
sw2276A-ms98-a,46,A,218.35525,224.445875,6.090625,yeah although i do worry that how easy this one was might be a bad lesson,1,0
sw2277A-ms98-a,14,A,35.001125,38.59025,3.589125,yeah that would seem like that would be uh more expensive than a uh,1,0
sw2277A-ms98-a,76,A,362.571375,373.159875,10.5885,we- i'll i'll say something i said in the last conversation i hope i'm never in that position where i have to be put in one uh from all i've heard about it just not and i've heard,1,0
sw2277B-ms98-a,7,B,21.7335,31.94025,10.20675,you know that's sixteen hours because_1 one would come in the morning and one would be at night i mean in the afternoon and then that night it wouldn't need one,1,0
sw2277B-ms98-a,8,B,31.94025,35.510375,3.570125,you know because_1 she would be sleeping so i would be here then,2,0
sw2277B-ms98-a,34,B,155.14325,164.599625,9.456375,and i told her uh i came up there the following week and it was gone i said where is it she said in the washer i said i tell you what when i come back it better be here,1,0
sw2277B-ms98-a,56,B,276.52975,279.97025,3.4405,and it's really not some people don't need to be in there,1,0
sw2277B-ms98-a,58,B,284.7695,295.448875,10.679375,that's right and i don't think that's right i think they should have a place to some of the people that don't need to be in the nursing home with nurses they need to have a place for them_1 like a retirement home,1,0
sw2277B-ms98-a,65,B,311.660875,318.975,7.314125,and see that would be okay you could have somebody check on each one of them_1 every day you know go by and see what they need,1,0
sw2277B-ms98-a,128,B,572.055125,582.83,10.774875,and then you know it's like i tell him you make more money than i do than i could ever really think about if i made as much money as my brother i would be just like set for life ,1,0
sw2277B-ms98-a,130,B,591.8105,595.055375,3.244875,which i probably if i got what i wanted i'd be okay,1,0
sw2278A-ms98-a,42,A,141.5135,145.09675,3.58325,hey the guy's making millions he ought to be able to perform right ,1,0
sw2278A-ms98-a,139,A,462.541625,467.58825,5.046625,what he'll be able to do he's been last year he started having some nagging injuries and,1,0
sw2278A-ms98-a,140,A,467.58825,476.09775,8.5095,but it'll it'll be interesting to watch i hope to get up there we we usually try to get to opening day game there's several guys from our church try to go up there,1,0
sw2278B-ms98-a,53,B,195.51475,201.00275,5.488, you don't expect them_1 to be uh much of anything but thugs no i know i was born there ,1,0

sw2279A-ms98-a,55,A,240.4355,248.633875,8.198375,hard for me because you know it's like you grow up to be twenty years old and it's always the same man and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old,1,0
sw2279A-ms98-a,56,A,248.633875,252.17875,3.544875,and he wants to be best friends but uh you know it's like,1,0

sw2281A-ms98-a,85,A,377.62025,386.819625,9.199375,in terms of subways and just  just the general transition i mean it i didn't you know i really  you have to be interested in the subject too i think that was part of my problem,1,0
sw2281A-ms98-a,87,A,389.3055,401.98725,12.68175,anything to be real interesting yeah well it's good to talk to somebody i don't read as much as i used to um my husband's a TIer and i'm in journalism so i do a lot of writing um during the normal course of my job and it's kind of um,1,0

sw2282A-ms98-a,11,A,59.497375,71.7175,12.220125,when when she's going to be in prison for the rest of her life with no chance of parole ah what good does it do anybody and the taxpayers are going to be footing the bill for the rest of her life she's a young young woman uh in her late twenties i guess,2,0

sw2282A-ms98-a,48,A,304.99625,311.248125,6.251875,well people who tend to be say on death row th- i think they're kept in isolation all the time,1,0
sw2282A-ms98-a,51,A,325.646625,338.949875,13.30325,right well  it's it's it's real small but uh like i said i mean the death penalty could probably be justified if if the evidence if there's no doubt no i never have,1,0
sw2282B-ms98-a,4,B,18.0135,32.248875,14.235375, i don't know i have a i have a real gut response that says nobody's got a you know a right to take anybody else's life on the other hand i have seen an awful lot of i've lived in major cities and i have kind of come to the conclusion that there are certain people that should just be shot,1,0
sw2282B-ms98-a,15,B,118.941625,125.9955,7.053875,um if you were on a jury would would you be able to to give somebody a death sentence,1,0

sw2282B-ms98-a,52,B,405.746125,415.972,10.225875,what they did is they usually hired kids to do this because you uh would get a you know a lighter sentence or no sentence or probation or you know something trivial and it'd be the same damn kids,1,0
sw2282B-ms98-a,55,B,452.45225,466.781875,14.329625,yeah yeah i you know i really don't know wh- what i would do in that situation if i had to to make that judgment i think i would i think i'd be very easily swayed by fellow jurors,1,0

sw2282B-ms98-a,70,B,559.508,566.982625,7.474625,uh then the big you know my big problem would be is what if you were in a in a state that absolutely did not allow it,1,0
sw2283A-ms98-a,45,A,267.836125,280.328875,12.49275,beans like to be near certain types of plants now they they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like uh peas i don't know something,1,0
sw2283A-ms98-a,59,A,339.538125,346.216625,6.6785,but i don't think the vines have they don't really they don't have to be touching or anything like you say they cross pollinate just by bees,1,0

sw2284A-ms98-a,47,A,265.438875,277.699875,12.261,i just see that ultimately who's going to be in charge of this one world order you know what i mean is is George Bush really any better than Saddam Hussein or does he just look better do you know what i'm saying i mean i think one person,1,0
sw2284A-ms98-a,49,A,292.52575,305.547375,13.021625,that's just a real good thing but i think it's something that's going to happen but i guess that's what i feel happen with the war and that was the motive of the war was to try and break that up and so that they could be you know,1,0

sw2284B-ms98-a,12,B,39.131625,48.8,9.668375,the  the guy should have been ousted out of there and now we don't seem to be as interested in in doing what's right ,1,0
sw2284B-ms98-a,29,B,159.366625,163.65725,4.290625,it's a whole monopoly that needs to be broken up that's for sure,1,0
sw2284B-ms98-a,83,B,454.042875,456.099375,2.0565, it will be,1,0
sw2285A-ms98-a,18,A,220.24675,227.939375,7.692625,and sound their sirens  pretty much telling people be wary you know and get off the beach,1,0

sw2285A-ms98-a,40,A,392.9035,401.80225,8.89875,well i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too we're talking these kids are fourteen years old The parents might be thirty years old,1,0
sw2285A-ms98-a,50,A,485.4725,500.46875,14.99625,just because i mean not just because i wouldn't feel safe it's just because that i would be reminded every day of something that i don't see and i might see it on a you know a a Sixty Minute special,1,0
sw2285A-ms98-a,59,A,574.285375,578.060125,3.77475,i think there would be trouble in our house so you wouldn't get confronted or anything,1,0
sw2286A-ms98-a,73,A,296.474,301.24375,4.76975,didn't make enough to to be able to put anything in it so i had to leave  ,1,0

sw2286B-ms98-a,110,B,591.21725,600.37725,9.16,it uh quite a different world isn't it  versus be- life before real world life in coll-,1,0
sw2287A-ms98-a,56,A,245.838875,254.2025,8.363625,yeah i voted absentee one year i really was going to be gone so i i did it but uh it was nice i would be tempted to do it again,2,0
sw2287A-ms98-a,68,A,316.035125,323.392375,7.35725,yeah that would be i usually vote a lot of times i'll vote a straight party ticket just because i don't take the time to find out what every,1,0
sw2287A-ms98-a,76,A,365.217,370.809125,5.592125,no i guess it'd be best if you knew what each person and  what they stood for and why and everything but,1,0

sw2287B-ms98-a,16,B,68.492375,73.593,5.100625,but uh so i don't know i it'll be interesting to see how the next uh,1,0
sw2287B-ms98-a,42,B,164.588875,176.48725,11.898375,they'll strike a chord in something you know in some of the people that so will say well you know this guy's got everything together you know i like what he says you know it'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him,1,0
sw2287B-ms98-a,73,B,308.04625,316.553125,8.506875,you know everybody gets to vote on you know well should he be for this and uh you know on and on and on and uh it's it's interesting,1,0
sw2287B-ms98-a,85,B,373.98625,381.61325,7.627,have the ti- find the time also to r- read about the guy and and be able to find the information about what he stands for,1,0
sw2287B-ms98-a,95,B,428.631375,434.0395,5.408125,they really do i i sometimes think that that should be limited ,1,0
sw2288A-ms98-a,48,A,341.94575,353.057,11.11125,oh oh it definitely is and i tell you what if you work hard enough it'll happen  because i can we can see it you know i think it's going to be a couple of years before i can do that,1,0

sw2288B-ms98-a,4,B,20.592125,31.979625,11.3875,uh of of staying in some semblance of control but uh we we do have uh we we never seem to be able to stick with it,1,0
sw2288B-ms98-a,22,B,104.872,112.7095,7.8375,figure it's going to be it's never what it was last month and uh and uh you know it's it's the one that's always the killer,1,0
sw2288B-ms98-a,36,B,179.396375,185.84825,6.451875,and uh i think i think we'd be totally bankrupt if we didn't do something um,1,0
sw2288B-ms98-a,52,B,285.152625,296.379125,11.2265,is meant to position ourselves so finan- uh the these financial problems won't be problems uh in the future and uh so,1,0
sw2288B-ms98-a,68,B,335.443125,339.106375,3.66325,i- i don't know that we'd ever be able to get to that point but uh,1,0
sw2289A-ms98-a,2,A,0.253625,4.814625,4.561,okay we we can uh be recorded while we talk about it,1,0
sw2289A-ms98-a,39,A,289.495375,294.499625,5.00425,well i think i- i would be like when i bring my bottles back,1,0
sw2289B-ms98-a,27,B,218.6975,223.476125,4.778625,so it's a question should i be diligent and um um,1,0
sw2290B-ms98-a,70,B,319.430875,328.303375,8.8725, it had to be you you couldn't catch one to save your life ,1,0
sw2290B-ms98-a,87,B,388.162125,389.978625,1.8165,that would be fun,1,0
sw2290B-ms98-a,95,B,435.426625,443.709,8.282375,something grabs and just runs with it and of course there's no hook so it can't be a fish i'm i'm sure it's not a fish right,1,0
sw2291A-ms98-a,24,A,143.795625,156.596625,12.801,we're in uh as i said a small town in Indiana and it's a WASP community with a student body of five hundred in the high school so the setting is very different than it would be in,1,0
sw2291A-ms98-a,30,A,182.488625,186.982875,4.49425,to be i think very effective unless i have my head in the sand,1,0
sw2291A-ms98-a,66,A,405.276,419.467375,14.191375,i think really uh the school does have more of that student's time because eight hours of the time that the student is with the parent they're going to be sleeping and certainly the parent needs some social life besides uh ,1,0
sw2291A-ms98-a,68,A,429.031875,433.18,4.148125,they might need to be dealt with yeah,1,0
sw2291B-ms98-a,24,B,142.215125,144.293875,2.07875,um that that can be yeah,1,0
sw2291B-ms98-a,39,B,224.263,233.9385,9.6755,yeah the i- i find that i- i haven't seen any cases where that's been very effective and that seems to be what people want to do is just you know put more money into it,1,0
sw2291B-ms98-a,42,B,243.582875,248.895625,5.31275,i would like to see them be more of a professional organization rather than a union,1,0
sw2291B-ms98-a,52,B,288.1425,299.147875,11.005375,uh but you know back to the idea of parents i my my personal feelings is that parents need to be taking more responsibility,1,0
sw2291B-ms98-a,62,B,354.916125,367.52025,12.604125,yeah it's it's the big cities that have these kind of problems and there i like to see that the parents be able to have a choice saying i don't like the way this school is being run i want to send my child to someplace where they'll be properly uh,2,0
sw2291B-ms98-a,85,B,491.76475,496.36275,4.598,yes  that was going to be my guess,1,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,9,A,37.330875,48.78025,11.449375,would make him kind of be on call all the time and have to go in at any time and you know even on the weekends and and um and things so that was important to me and also insurance,1,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,10,A,48.78025,59.473625,10.693375,for the fa- our family because we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it,2,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,34,A,143.827625,149.992,6.164375,we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over and,1,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,43,A,205.594125,215.996125,10.402,well my husband does not like to commute very far and and we don't like him to be you know having to drive an hour to work or ,1,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,44,A,215.996125,227.90475,11.908625, so we kind of looked for where where the uh his office would be located and how far well he's uh you know he's at the one that's at um,1,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,46,A,237.835875,251.497375,13.6615,e- especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didn't want him to let you know to like we had some job offers in the New York area and we thought well you know he would be really commuting ,1,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,49,A,273.054625,280.461,7.406375,made us be more together and and what other can you think of another thing that you guys looked at and,1,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,55,A,308.52425,319.72875,11.2045,um-hum that's true that's really important um also what um opportunities there would be for advancement,1,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,56,A,319.72875,327.082875,7.354125,i think we looked at besides just you know what salary you would be ha- having now but when,1,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,71,A,399.3515,406.93525,7.58375,felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some uh opportunity for,2,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,80,A,450.39475,454.104875,3.710125,you never know we're hoping that that  be the case we,1,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,95,A,531.9985,538.49075,6.49225,yeah and it is i think it is important to you know want to be close to your family and,1,0
sw2292A-ms98-a,101,A,550.238875,564.76225,14.523375,we're really enjoying it i wonder what it would be like i mean i i wanted to be close to family but i also thought that it would be harder to be close to family  but it's turned out really good and i think that you know we're really satisfied with that choice and,4,0
sw2292B-ms98-a,16,B,104.70375,114.97875,10.275,and uh i especially liked the prescription especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time  that those prescriptions can be very expensive,1,0
sw2292B-ms98-a,74,B,440.1565,452.19625,12.03975,in a big company though you also get moved around a  he may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some  or or we may be having to drive to Plano you never know ,2,0
sw2292B-ms98-a,84,B,507.266625,521.21475,13.948125,and so our our families are are are really far away in fact this is    the topic but yesterday my mother happened to be on a train going from Phoenix to back to Chicago and it stopped in Dallas for a half an hour so,1,0
sw2292B-ms98-a,91,B,555.99825,558.9865,2.98825,yeah sometimes it can be ,1,0
sw2293A-ms98-a,38,A,266.995625,281.82275,14.827125,you know it's i mean i it it should probably be a big issue you know because_1 i- it's doing a lot of damage but i it's something you know i don't think many people really think about it because it's nothing they i don't think we really have too much control over it,1,0
sw2293B-ms98-a,11,B,28.392,34.16,5.768,uh puts a whole yeah gets a whole new picture to what  real air pollution can be,1,0
sw2293B-ms98-a,19,B,73.721,83.780875,10.059875,you see an awful lot of uh one person vehicles on the road on during rush hours that seems to be our biggest problem down here um,1,0
sw2293B-ms98-a,32,B,166.01375,176.994875,10.981125,in the morning sometime uh just y- you can tell if it's a good day or a bad day by uh how far out from downtown uh y- you can be on the road and still not see it,1,0
sw2293B-ms98-a,50,B,293.470375,305.309875,11.8395,it it could go on for years and years until they they s- start to see some results and people can actually actually say yeah it's it's it's doing it's doing some damage and and something's got to be done,1,0
sw2294A-ms98-a,20,A,179.49675,189.24375,9.747,so it's got to be up to the judges i think we need we have to put into place judges that are stricter than the ones that are in there now,1,0
sw2294A-ms98-a,48,A,316.4945,319.31025,2.81575,you deserve to be killed also,1,0
sw2294A-ms98-a,64,A,426.2325,433.480375,7.247875,so that has to be looked at too um i don't know who they're protecting they're not protecting the innocent that's for sure,1,0
sw2294B-ms98-a,27,B,318.486125,322.287,3.800875,that should be automatic death penalty no if ands or buts ,1,0
sw2294B-ms98-a,50,B,526.99875,533.49425,6.4955,all things considered i'd rather be a cop on the street because_1 once i walk inside the gates the inmates have more rights than i do,1,0
sw2294B-ms98-a,51,B,533.49425,545.7225,12.22825,say an inmate swings at me or he's raised his fist threateningly toward me i've got to let him hit me before i can hit him back to be justified have it called what they call a justified use of force,1,0
sw2295A-ms98-a,6,A,26.52825,36.4865,9.95825,um  nursing homes to me i- i would personally be the last resort you know i rea- you know if i had to put someone in there,1,0
sw2295A-ms98-a,37,A,134.936125,149.334625,14.3985,yeah yeah yeah but i think when the time comes i- i hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at,1,0
sw2295A-ms98-a,58,A,223.532375,231.76325,8.230875,but of course i would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like  you know i mean that's way out of my reach ,1,0
sw2295A-ms98-a,85,A,328.60725,334.89025,6.283,but i really don't know what the other solution would be you know i really don't,1,0
sw2295A-ms98-a,90,A,361.732875,370.200375,8.4675,yes and li- like i said my sister's still in it and i really  don't think my mother want to be  either  ,1,0
sw2295B-ms98-a,29,B,156.1915,164.7555,8.564,there's one uh close to where my mother is but in order to get in you have to be able to um,1,0
sw2295B-ms98-a,30,B,164.7555,173.913125,9.157625,walk in on your own in other words you can't be in you know too bad a shape to start out with but then if you deteriorate um,1,0
sw2295B-ms98-a,32,B,180.405375,191.42375,11.018375,but it's always uh well and they have a long waiting list too so there's always this feeling of well golly gee you know you've got to be able to walk in the door so you can't wait until you're too bad off ,1,0
sw2295B-ms98-a,72,B,357.690125,360.1325,2.442375,that might be kind of tough huh,1,0
sw2296B-ms98-a,24,B,111.708875,117.234625,5.52575,the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape and uh,2,0
sw2296B-ms98-a,27,B,133.2445,145.20425,11.95975,and i often find that even when i don't feel that much like exercising like i'll be really tired and i'll start swimming and i'll act- and i'll actually get energy,1,0
sw2296B-ms98-a,28,B,145.20425,154.828125,9.623875,and i'll be have much more energy when i'm done than when i started i mean i just feel great that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim,1,0
sw2297B-ms98-a,20,B,58.86775,65.04575,6.178,and i you would be amazed i mean you you think well there's just two bolts on each side that holds the bumper,1,0
sw2298A-ms98-a,33,A,182.925125,186.48375,3.558625,it's either going to be repaid or just completely blown off,1,0
sw2298A-ms98-a,53,A,301.70725,308.182875,6.475625,maybe now uh that we're putting that behind us that we'll be able to to address this in more depth,1,0
sw2298B-ms98-a,33,B,162.760375,165.05025,2.289875,yeah it's going to be uh,1,0
sw2298B-ms98-a,67,B,315.615,323.751125,8.136125,yeah this will be a first i uh usually end up getting uh told i got three seconds to wrap it up or five seconds or something like that,1,0
sw2299A-ms98-a,57,A,256.27425,259.3165,3.04225,no there's not going to be any room shortly,1,0
sw2299A-ms98-a,62,A,273.707375,279.13475,5.427375,but you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would  would be worth but ,1,0
sw2299B-ms98-a,17,B,74.619625,83.852875,9.23325,have them_1 pick that up but that's the extent of what i've done i'd like to be able to do more the problem is with a lot of it is you have to go,1,0
sw2300A-ms98-a,35,A,147.712875,161.88675,14.173875,we you know we have a lot for to be our age and you know just everything and having the responsibilities we've had on us for at such a young age you know we have a like a nice house people you know are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house,1,0
sw2300A-ms98-a,75,A,314.265125,327.79775,13.532625,you have the clothes on your back and you might have a car and that kind of thing and so when he when he started working at TI we uh you know we really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas,1,0
sw2300A-ms98-a,116,A,527.324625,541.721625,14.397,you know that is another thing that you know we feel like our long term goal  going to be benefitted by next time we buy a car we're not just going to go to Toyota of Irving you know we're going to go to somebody that we know we're going to take someone with us older and we didn't do any of those things ,1,0
sw2300B-ms98-a,31,B,250.65125,263.7245,13.07325,but you know they- they're uh since your husband is is is um uh a TIer but doesn't have the loans with the credit union they're offering something that might be worth taking a gander at i don't know what your percent is on your on your car payments,1,0
sw2300B-ms98-a,37,B,287.956375,296.193375,8.237,i think they even cover that because they want you as a uh uh they want the TIer to be part of the credit union,1,0
sw2300B-ms98-a,53,B,433.381125,438.8725,5.491375,if if if if and you need to be very careful,1,0
sw2300B-ms98-a,59,B,484.42525,493.839125,9.413875,i mean you can ask and you can wheel and deal but it's not as open as it it should be it's a great idea hell i'd love to cut ours in half but uh man,1,0
sw2300B-ms98-a,74,B,596.9735,601.026,4.0525,might be a good idea because_1 because_1 you're going to get what a a check uh,1,0
sw2301A-ms98-a,30,A,115.256375,125.180875,9.9245,yeah that's what they've they've talked about it of course it eliminates any waiting period and God help those people who have to float checks occasionally because_1 you won't be able to with that,1,0
sw2301A-ms98-a,33,A,128.488625,132.20325,3.714625,oh it was well they consider it to be the same as cash,1,0
sw2301B-ms98-a,30,B,108.508625,115.0065,6.497875,but you know the instant thing may be may may be the way of the future to you know to replace checks and every other thing,2,0
sw2301B-ms98-a,54,B,181.752125,183.129,1.376875,that may not be a bad idea,1,0
sw2302A-ms98-a,3,A,9.805,21.61475,11.80975,there would be real possible for uh payoffs you know briberies uh unfairness one-sidedness you know all those kinds of things,1,0
sw2302A-ms98-a,4,A,21.61475,31.89825,10.2835,and i i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody,1,0
sw2302A-ms98-a,32,A,203.487625,207.159625,3.672,yeah that's uh that could be a good idea to uh that could work,1,0
sw2302B-ms98-a,5,B,62.12275,68.896625,6.773875,but for anything involving that  a trial by jury certainly should be mandatory ,1,0
sw2302B-ms98-a,6,B,68.896625,72.205,3.308375,but there should be uh with our,1,0
sw2302B-ms98-a,8,B,74.454875,81.098625,6.64375,uh judicial system it seems to me like there ought to be a means of,1,0
sw2302B-ms98-a,12,B,89.545625,98.481375,8.93575,full court you know maybe there ought to be some kind of of uh a- as as an example where called a jury duty now,1,0
sw2302B-ms98-a,36,B,327.0915,335.753,8.6615,well that may be right it's in there some place i think we both know w- that we're talking about the foundation of our legal society,1,0
sw2302B-ms98-a,38,B,337.412375,344.722375,7.31,and too the that was sort of the the beginning of ye shall be treated fairly,1,0
sw2303A-ms98-a,20,A,92.937375,107.264,14.326625,they feel like well you know the country's real important and you know if i el- if we help elect a president who's going to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know,1,0
sw2303A-ms98-a,45,A,239.170875,244.2105,5.039625,just go in and say oh i want to be a juror i can spot a guilty person a mile away,1,0
sw2303A-ms98-a,47,A,252.867875,262.749625,9.88175,well that that just seems to be a person who just doesn't care about much of anything around sort of you know doesn't doesn't sort of likes rights probably but doesn't like respon- responsibilities,1,0
sw2303A-ms98-a,49,A,264.5925,275.021125,10.428625,i mean that's that's what it what it boils down to is people like to s- you know people say well i don't want to be on jury you know i don't want to serve on jury duty i don't want to vote i don't want to do this and that well then they could you know i,1,0
sw2303A-ms98-a,50,A,275.021125,282.649375,7.62825,put them in the reverse situation in the place where they don't have the right to be on jury duty and and they don't have the right to vote i suspect their opinions would change very quickly,1,0
sw2303A-ms98-a,104,A,495.862625,497.583875,1.72125,so they're going to be,1,0
sw2303A-ms98-a,109,A,504.6845,515.2735,10.589,well in some sense they they should be politicians in that you know you want them to respect the people and you don't want them to have you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge,3,0
sw2303A-ms98-a,130,A,595.579125,599.136125,3.557,that that that that that would be interesting yes i think that would work in some places yeah,1,0
sw2303B-ms98-a,17,B,149.619,152.527125,2.908125, tend not to be registered,1,0
sw2303B-ms98-a,24,B,209.645375,223.59375,13.948375,   i i just i tha- i just wandered off from that one i was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection,1,0
sw2303B-ms98-a,26,B,226.848125,230.964625,4.1165,so they were if they don't vote they don't have to be on a jury,1,0
sw2303B-ms98-a,72,B,479.310875,489.0455,9.734625,what the sto- the actual facts are at this point i don't i don't really know if some of the poor judges that are just trying to decide how it should be divided,1,0
sw2303B-ms98-a,76,B,495.66225,502.339125,6.676875,and that's an- and that's another interesting question should judges be elected or appointed,1,0
sw2304A-ms98-a,35,A,113.241,121.12925,7.88825,it used to be in Georgetown years ago he moved i guess he he retired and went back to Argentina i guess in nine- the early seventies,1,0
sw2305A-ms98-a,26,A,179.127125,192.06,12.932875,Um and from that point i went to law school and after a year and a half of that i decided i didn't want that either  haven't figured out what i want to be when i grow up,1,0
sw2305A-ms98-a,27,A,192.06,206.717875,14.657875,and so but i i i really did enjoy the law i mean that's that's where i wanted to be but i didn't want to go through the uh the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney i just wanted a law degree,2,0
sw2305A-ms98-a,28,A,206.717875,217.0785,10.360625,and i've since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field because that's the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what i like,1,0
sw2305A-ms98-a,44,A,262.3105,275.442875,13.132375,yeah i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet i said uh i couldn't do this everyday no way,1,0
sw2305A-ms98-a,46,A,276.718625,283.64225,6.923625,maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing,1,0
sw2305A-ms98-a,66,A,397.926875,409.6875,11.760625,um but it's such a grind and you begin to wonder you know if if i'm not i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer,1,0
sw2305B-ms98-a,46,B,239.02625,249.086125,10.059875,yeah it's it's actually turning out to be more more useful than what i thought and um i also have a good languages background linguistics,1,0
sw2305B-ms98-a,62,B,301.22175,315.612375,14.390625, i i i think yeah there is i i i think uh law would be a fine field a fine profession fine field to go into um i know one time i was in a political science class and you know talking about,1,0
sw2305B-ms98-a,68,B,343.84,347.9225,4.0825,or or Jewish it used to be Jewish you know,1,0
sw2305B-ms98-a,73,B,360.125,372.071875,11.946875,yeah i have a  i have a friend she's studying she's going into law another friend going into law and that she's i i i'm really i'm really concerned about you know she's just going to be,1,0
sw2305B-ms98-a,74,B,372.071875,380.2395,8.167625,you know what's going to happen when she gets there you know all of her dreams will be dispelled ,1,0
sw2305B-ms98-a,110,B,524.04,536.972,12.932,yeah i i i i i think i think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school i mean they they find out whether just how much of a people person they are ,1,0
sw2306A-ms98-a,3,A,7.265125,21.9805,14.715375,i happen to be a mystery fan and uh programs such as Perry Mason and Ironside and Murder She Wrote and Columbo all of those uh are m- my favorite kinds of programs,1,0

sw2306B-ms98-a,82,B,511.99025,516.66575,4.6755,oh that must be neat to see what happens to them like that,1,0
sw2307A-ms98-a,75,A,400.161625,410.27,10.108375,they they feel claustrophobic around trees i thought that was hilarious when i first heard it but i mean i heard it from more than one person so it's got to be somewhat true i mean,1,0
sw2307B-ms98-a,34,B,136.942625,148.356375,11.41375,yes we do they peak on  so if you have a chance to be here Friday or some- somewhere around there that that's the best time to see them and they don't last too long  know,1,0
sw2307B-ms98-a,54,B,247.237125,257.25425,10.017125,but uh i always wondered about the South i figured that there couldn't be too many months   trees were were bare because it's it's hot most of the time ,1,0
sw2308A-ms98-a,14,A,145.085,155.802125,10.717125,um we don't have that problem up here we might maybe in a rural uh maybe there's a bad uh a bad home in a rural area but it would be a very small one,1,0
sw2308A-ms98-a,18,A,190.18525,200.492875,10.307625,um he said well these people here are they are very nice to her and he was saying his excuses if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice,1,0
sw2308A-ms98-a,41,A,403.888125,416.200875,12.31275,in-house help so he he's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will uh be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day,1,0
sw2308A-ms98-a,50,A,493.17225,506.272375,13.100125,if i brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home i- i don't want to be a s- selfish you know a burden on anyone that's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through ,1,0
sw2308B-ms98-a,11,B,131.68275,142.977125,11.294375,you know they may not like the fact that they've been put in there and they might complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there and you know,1,0
sw2309A-ms98-a,7,A,13.843,22.902375,9.059375,well i think it's a good idea i think our justice system needs a major overhaul and i'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it but i think they've got a lot of problems,1,0
sw2309A-ms98-a,27,A,137.819875,141.517,3.697125,do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury,1,0
sw2309A-ms98-a,36,A,173.736125,176.18125,2.445125,i think it does have to be unanimous,1,0
sw2309A-ms98-a,42,A,193.782625,196.47875,2.696125,majority might be sufficient,1,0
sw2309A-ms98-a,53,A,232,237.098625,5.098625,yeah i think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street,1,0
sw2309A-ms98-a,76,A,321.04,332.233375,11.193375,i think i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know actually make them_1 do something that's not pleasant,1,0
sw2309B-ms98-a,8,B,34.099625,43.103875,9.00425,sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion,1,0
sw2309B-ms98-a,13,B,64.997,77.55075,12.55375, i don't know if that is best left up to the jury to de- to award you know two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing you know it it's true that you know this may be sad and all that thing but uh ,1,0
sw2309B-ms98-a,33,B,166.73425,174.29375,7.5595,exactly but they took you know whatever the majority was so i didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is i always thought it had to be unanimous,1,0
sw2309B-ms98-a,44,B,200.582125,204.42525,3.843125,trials do you think they should have a jury there i think that would be kind of interesting,1,0
sw2309B-ms98-a,51,B,223.896,229.96425,6.06825,but i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of you know  people from different countries,1,0
sw2309B-ms98-a,58,B,242.235625,246.070625,3.835,i don't know how what it what it would take to be come up with a true perfect ,1,0
sw2309B-ms98-a,63,B,262.242,268.065,5.823,um-hum  i think there should be a core minimum that they get but uh,1,0
sw2309B-ms98-a,64,B,268.065,278.049625,9.984625,i guess there should be some flexibility because_1 every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature,2,0
sw2310A-ms98-a,22,A,96.10225,103.79525,7.693,and uh let my family know when he was going to be in and they went out to the freight claiming area out at uh DFW airport and claimed him,1,0
sw2310A-ms98-a,61,A,265.62875,273.26875,7.64,and we were told when we got there that it'd be good to get a dog because uh there were a lot of uh breaking and entering and robberies,1,0
sw2310A-ms98-a,62,A,273.26875,283.27725,10.0085,and the uh native Malays by religion are scared of dogs in fact the lick of a dog is supposed to be something very very bad something very evil,1,0
sw2310B-ms98-a,109,B,574.877,581.45375,6.57675,well he might be canvassing the neighborhood you just might be the last stop on his uh on his route during the day ,2,0
sw2311A-ms98-a,25,A,167.177,170.661875,3.484875,yeah and i- it's got to be more expensive ,1,0
sw2311A-ms98-a,38,A,236.004875,244.90625,8.901375,but the- they uh the pants just aren't dressy enough but in the wintertime i think i would be    pants,1,0
sw2311A-ms98-a,50,A,341.54475,356.534875,14.990125,yeah and in the wintertime pretty much just uh um even a turtleneck's all right because you have to wear these smocks a turtleneck and a sweater and the smock would be too much it it gets really hot,1,0
sw2311A-ms98-a,57,A,382.366,391.95225,9.58625,yeah and their shirts have to be pressed so they still have the same thing where if they could dress casually it would take them less time too,1,0
sw2311A-ms98-a,62,A,431.70225,439.241,7.53875,and there's no way i could wear them all day i would be the one of the women in flats ,1,0
sw2311A-ms98-a,66,A,463.685875,475.974,12.288125,no we don't at all um we used to be a lot busier so um we it used to be important what you wore if you're comfortable because_1 you knew you were going to spend a lot of time working,2,0
sw2311B-ms98-a,75,B,258.333125,268.346,10.012875,i would love a job where i didn't it it wouldn't be casual all the time but i didn't have to be dressy all the time and i could wear more fun clothes,2,0
sw2311B-ms98-a,135,B,458.506,462.615125,4.109125,oh jeez oh it must be painful yeah,1,0
sw2311B-ms98-a,149,B,507.885375,513.315375,5.43,well i'll be thinking of you dressing casually  at night  when i go to work,1,0
sw2311B-ms98-a,161,B,538.553375,539.999875,1.4465,that would be fun though,1,0
sw2312A-ms98-a,90,A,444.444375,451.687125,7.24275,because uh it was supposed to be something like a sh- uh singing and like like a musical but yeah,1,0
sw2312B-ms98-a,46,B,188.907125,194.614625,5.7075, there's just not as many really good shows on i think as there used to be,1,0
sw2312B-ms98-a,108,B,461.92625,466.408,4.48175,i don't think it was supposed to be funny ,1,0
sw2313A-ms98-a,43,A,260.435,268.466375,8.031375,it's interesting that that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible and this year it's ten percent or so,1,0
sw2313A-ms98-a,90,A,485.689875,499.89675,14.206875,you know almost well i guess it's the day after uh technically it's two days but the- the- they took that check and scurried it to the bank and the bank scurried it back to my account and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float but apparently that's why the uh ,1,0
sw2314A-ms98-a,34,A,200.85625,207.89725,7.041,well not being a drug user i don't have a problem with that personally but i think that might be a violation of someone's rights if someone's,1,0
sw2314A-ms98-a,35,A,207.89725,218.77675,10.8795,having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to ha- behave differently and their manager assumes they have a drug problem i mean if someone assumed that of me i would be upset,1,0
sw2314A-ms98-a,41,A,249.464625,259.205125,9.7405,the i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from from the janitors to the executive management,1,0
sw2314B-ms98-a,4,B,22.47425,31.0575,8.58325,like uh truck drivers and things like that i definitely think they should be tested and and i'm not i'm not opposed to any testing i mean,1,0
sw2314B-ms98-a,6,B,34.11625,46.427125,12.310875,you know be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or you know because he was on drugs while he was there,1,0
sw2314B-ms98-a,37,B,187.21525,201.068875,13.853625,well do you think that should be implemented in the work place you know as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs do you think they should have the right to send them_1,1,0
sw2314B-ms98-a,38,B,201.068875,203.2025,2.133625,to be tested,1,0
sw2314B-ms98-a,47,B,219.865625,222.586,2.720375,yeah  it would almost be like a ,1,0
sw2314B-ms98-a,58,B,266.678875,271.980625,5.30175,three years it'll be three years in August and i've already been drug tested three times,1,0
sw2315A-ms98-a,21,A,129.1175,139.826625,10.709125,i maybe it's something to do with the front wheel drive and they're supposed to be good in snow but they're very popular up here in Vermont and a lot of people used to bring his car their cars,1,0
sw2315A-ms98-a,26,A,187.4705,200.78075,13.31025,they don't repossess that many cars up here figure in a big metropolitan area there would be a lot of uh where they repo- they uh take their cars for illegal activities you know it,1,0
sw2315A-ms98-a,76,A,576.8155,586.587625,9.772125, that's a good way to do it um the thing about it is you got to you got to like to work on cars to be a mechanic if you want to be involved and that's a hard job,2,0
sw2315B-ms98-a,3,B,7.696375,11.276125,3.57975,because it'd be nice to uh pack the kids and the dog in,1,0
sw2315B-ms98-a,10,B,37.400875,42.7815,5.380625,uh definitely next car we'll get will be a used car because_1 we can't afford a new car they're so expensive,1,0
sw2315B-ms98-a,26,B,131.82325,133.602875,1.779625,that might be i don't know,1,0
sw2315B-ms98-a,34,B,160.651,175.584375,14.933375,yeah one thing i like to do is is go to a police auction and get a car because_1 i've heard you can get pretty good deals but you have to be kind of patient because_1 you can't always just go in and get something right away l- l- like the Dallas Police Department has a car auction every Monday morning from like nine till twelve,1,0
sw2315B-ms98-a,61,B,301.86075,315.827875,13.967125,i think the next car we get too might also be one of those uh import kinds because_1 i don't trust American made cars now i don't think they have the quality and that's that's too bad because_1 i mean i have to keep the money in the country but on the other hand with my money i'm spending i want to get something that's worth my money,1,0
sw2315B-ms98-a,105,B,560.461375,570.3175,9.856125,i always told my wife that if i had to do it over again i would uh have my own car dealership and used car dealership and uh she'd be be a travel agent,2,0
sw2316A-ms98-a,29,A,255.55025,270.043625,14.493375,trying to work and or maybe they're unemployed and they're mad at the world i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a a kid you know he's coming up will you help me with my homework and they're no get away from me i've had a terrible day,1,0
sw2316A-ms98-a,47,A,391.664625,406.623875,14.95925,i don't know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and t- to see what they need and not overinflate it,1,0
sw2316A-ms98-a,50,A,431.59075,443.754375,12.163625,we've uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa,1,0
sw2316B-ms98-a,66,B,552.718875,563.192125,10.47325,but at the same time it's really not it's not like going to MIT my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of MIT and that's it's really too bad,1,0
sw2317A-ms98-a,152,A,443.2955,452.705375,9.409875,course i'm tend to be a slow learner i guess anyway but it's a lot of fun and it's it's a good way to get exercise you know fooling yourself because you don't realize you're getting exercise,1,0
sw2317A-ms98-a,180,A,529.628625,539.456,9.827375,yeah well it's so neat because it's right there and i can go just right after work and you know before i get home because once i get home that that tends to be it ,1,0
sw2317B-ms98-a,20,B,53.817,60.081125,6.264125, i don't want to be paid to do it because_1 then it becomes a job and then it's not a hobby you know,1,0
sw2317B-ms98-a,35,B,109.2955,115.64075,6.34525,and i always tell people if you ever go up in one you just that's it you be hooked ,1,0
sw2317B-ms98-a,173,B,571.679125,578.306,6.626875,my husband likes the weights period that's it he wants to be up like he wants to he says i'm going to pump up i said uh-huh,1,0
sw2318A-ms98-a,2,A,0.55375,6.056375,5.502625,yeah so it's got to be the most controversial thing if you could pick on the list,1,0
sw2318A-ms98-a,17,A,104.338125,111.539375,7.20125,but you're the one who you can't you can't make the decision and go yes or no i'd be a terrible president because,1,0
sw2318A-ms98-a,18,A,111.539375,124.89175,13.352375,i would you know i knew we had to go to war and i knew you know it was the best thing but i didn't i would not want to be responsible for people getting hurt if you know if i don't know,1,0
sw2318A-ms98-a,65,A,402.152625,409.387875,7.23525,i mean if this happened in the city the i'm sure the youth would be armed and just take the family out,1,0
sw2318A-ms98-a,68,A,418.887875,432.78975,13.901875,can't can't get out of the situation they're in and they're they'll eventually end up even if they want to be good kids they'll eventually end up uh more or less victims of crimes even though they're doing the crimes they're more or less a victim,1,0
sw2318B-ms98-a,15,B,90.86425,97.88375,7.0195,and yet  although he may never be free to kill again there are a lot of people like him that are free to kill again ,1,0
sw2318B-ms98-a,23,B,124.298,130.2425,5.9445,i don't think that i could sit on a jury and be part of sentencing someone to death,1,0
sw2318B-ms98-a,35,B,190.55325,195.971875,5.418625,even uh be punished let alone put to death for it,1,0
sw2319A-ms98-a,17,A,57.9405,68.33425,10.39375,uh they won't do anything until the all star break and then uh then they'll perk up a little bit and that seems to be their uh their average pace but ,1,0
sw2319A-ms98-a,28,A,113.4875,117.12875,3.64125,yeah it would be interesting to see how he does this year,1,0
sw2319A-ms98-a,30,A,118.965875,130.27875,11.312875,yeah i heard uh just i guess last night they got beat uh and Bobby Witt was the pitcher and he's supposed to be uh you know their their hot guy,1,0
sw2319A-ms98-a,35,A,145.094875,148.982375,3.8875,and uh uh i don't know it's going to be interesting,1,0
sw2319A-ms98-a,37,A,153.580125,161.97075,8.390625,so uh hopefully if i'm real nice to him he's going throw a couple of those my way every now and then so it will be fun to go out there and watch them,1,0
sw2319A-ms98-a,41,A,181.811875,185.97975,4.167875,but uh i mean you got to be a total player when you're in the pros,1,0
sw2319A-ms98-a,51,A,209.7625,214.0095,4.247,right to to actually be a leader uh a team leader,1,0
sw2319A-ms98-a,53,A,222.822625,229.305125,6.4825,because Incaviglia i don't think you know uh he stands out to be a a real leader,1,0
sw2319A-ms98-a,57,A,245.57775,253.46725,7.8895,yeah so it be interesting to see you know i think and make him progress and uh get him on board ,1,0

sw2319A-ms98-a,118,A,463.491625,465.7555,2.263875,well it will be interesting,1,0
sw2319B-ms98-a,6,B,14.3615,18.967375,4.605875,basically be- because that's where i came from and uh grew up following them as a kid,1,0
sw2319B-ms98-a,14,B,43.227875,52.005,8.777125,they traded for a lot of new players uh in in the off season and it looks like it might help them but uh i think this is going to be a year for pulling together and looking for the future ,1,0
sw2319B-ms98-a,20,B,85.48475,87.95275,2.468,they might just be fishing to see what they can get for him,1,0

sw2325B-ms98-a,35,B,142.4505,154.997875,12.547375,and the the teacher had eleven kids it was excellent supposedly the reputation was fantastic for this place was supposed to be an excellent school and i had several friends who had had recommended it too but it really gets down to the particular teacher,1,0
sw2325B-ms98-a,40,B,179.224125,190.539,11.314875,you know it being a problem like he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said well you know at three years old i don't find that to be a behavioral     i mean it's kind of like she was,1,0
sw2325B-ms98-a,44,B,215.9835,226.70475,10.72125,the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them you know because there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms and i felt like,1,0
sw2325B-ms98-a,45,B,226.70475,233.612,6.90725,that was a big factor for me that they would would be safe you know from any kind of abuse or that kind of thing,1,0
sw2326A-ms98-a,2,A,1.194125,3.30625,2.112125,well that should be interesting,1,0
sw2326A-ms98-a,15,A,37.353,38.784625,1.431625,i'll be darned,1,0
sw2326A-ms98-a,41,A,184.883375,193.789375,8.906,but i think prob- probably my whole problem is going to be trying to find something that will that will blend you know uh fuel economy and and price and uh durability,1,0
sw2326A-ms98-a,44,A,199.90975,203.246,3.33625,i think it would be fun if you didn't have to pay for the repairs to it,1,0
sw2326A-ms98-a,71,A,310.58875,316.75575,6.167,yeah and those convertible tops used to be three hundred dollars i don't know what they are now probably eigh- probably eight hundred by now,1,0
sw2326B-ms98-a,21,B,62.906625,67.620125,4.7135,they just seemed to be more rugged but uh the cars just seem to fall apart,1,0
sw2326B-ms98-a,57,B,244.6685,250.890125,6.221625,i'll probably be heading down your way in uh oh the end of May end of April i guess when school's out,1,0
sw2327A-ms98-a,77,A,499.924,509.501,9.577,but uh some kind of a national service uh concept that might be geared around reducing that would be a i think would be a big step so,3,0
sw2327B-ms98-a,10,B,77.836875,90.728375,12.8915,in the uh like here in Maryland uh i just bought a uh a house for a hundred and forty one thousand it'd be about sixty thousand down there  and um,1,0
sw2327B-ms98-a,40,B,284.470375,291.761125,7.29075,you know people that are out there barely struggling to pay their uh house payment and buy food aren't going to be out buying you know anything else,1,0
sw2327B-ms98-a,43,B,299.771875,309.613625,9.84175,uh or pay the sales tax are the ones that are really you know have the money and they're out there buying the items maybe they should be you know paying more of the burden um,1,0
sw2327B-ms98-a,53,B,388.062625,394.807,6.744375,you know as we start to go into computerization and all the processes maybe we'll be able to streamline it,1,0
sw2327B-ms98-a,67,B,522.602875,527.37425,4.771375,um you know it used to be that communities would take care of their own,1,0
sw2328A-ms98-a,4,A,7.860625,21.626125,13.7655,and i uh am spending more time with my twenty five year old because at this point he happens to be single and always has been single and living at home uh while he's trying to uh,1,0
sw2328A-ms98-a,6,A,33.9175,47.57675,13.65925,the only thing i can say about the raising of these little things is that my sons-in-law seem to be so much more involved than my husband ever was or the husbands of our age group,1,0
sw2328A-ms98-a,86,A,366.603,380.83,14.227, you know alcoholism wasn't a problem resentment whatever was was not a problem at all because each one of our children was planned and he seemed to be the one who initiated having children so certainly he wanted them,1,0
sw2328B-ms98-a,14,B,47.056,53.161375,6.105375,uh-huh i'm kind of at the other extreme i have a nine month old and one that will be born in October,1,0
sw2328B-ms98-a,27,B,112.686875,123.71675,11.029875,and i think he has to be conscious of of uh needing to spend time with her if not then he gets wrapped up in the TV and the newspaper and whatever else and he says oh i didn't spend time with Emily,1,0
sw2328B-ms98-a,40,B,218.174375,226.84225,8.667875,uh-huh i think that's that's how i feel too i feel a need to dominate certain things and i try real hard not to be to too domineering with with Emily,1,0
sw2328B-ms98-a,42,B,235.7875,242.772375,6.984875,and i find you know i think okay i want Emily to be this way and this is what i'm going to do to make her be that way and then i think no you can't do that,2,0
sw2328B-ms98-a,44,B,251.781625,264.7385,12.956875,and so far it hasn't been too hard but she hasn't been making a whole lot of decisions on her own yet and so you know i guess i'm i'm just going to have to be real conscious of that as i as she gets older and does start making decisions,1,0
sw2328B-ms98-a,45,B,264.7385,269.087,4.3485,and be conscious that i need to give her options but not make the decisions for her,1,0
sw2329A-ms98-a,19,A,52.48825,58.485875,5.997625,so yeah it's going to be uh let's see next year i guess it will be an antique,2,0
sw2329A-ms98-a,54,A,228.588,239.16325,10.57525,because we used to go we we we uh built our home and we built it to we designed it to be heated by uh wood you know uh uh wood stove,1,0
sw2329A-ms98-a,62,A,262.18575,266.754625,4.568875,it was it was comfort and it has to be has to have air,1,0
sw2329A-ms98-a,81,A,330.747875,336.4155,5.667625,so that's that's one of your priorities there's got to be air has to be an automatic,2,0
sw2329B-ms98-a,80,B,273.060625,278.044875,4.98425,when it gets to be a hundred degrees every day for a month and a half ,1,0
sw2330A-ms98-a,22,A,106.632875,112.596125,5.96325,on the news in the evening lately but i think the average high would be it should be about seventy,2,0
sw2330A-ms98-a,33,A,161.08075,166.618875,5.538125,y- i mean any other time of year that's not the case because_1 it could be very warm or very cold,1,0
sw2330B-ms98-a,13,B,67.130375,75.51075,8.380375,in fact i'm a little worried about this one coming up here we have a long weekend and it sounds like it's gonna be a little bit on the cool side,1,0
sw2330B-ms98-a,15,B,78.00175,87.18575,9.184, i think there's an eighty percent chance this evening but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the rest'll be,2,0
sw2330B-ms98-a,17,B,89.18725,94.199625,5.012375, but i think the highs are gonna be in the sixties and the lows in the forties,1,0
sw2331A-ms98-a,66,A,344.41125,355.459125,11.047875,well she doesn't do much hunting she could care less about that she does a little fishing but you know golf would give her the exercise she'd be outside give her something to do that we both enjoy so,1,0
sw2331A-ms98-a,78,A,382.594,396.72975,14.13575,yeah and it's you know it's a game that you don't  like bowling you know you feel bad if you bowl a hundred but if you shoot a hundred in golf you know you don't have to be an expert to play any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right,1,0
sw2331A-ms98-a,79,A,396.72975,401.631125,4.901375,so you know you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all,1,0
sw2331B-ms98-a,22,B,73.028125,86.09975,13.071625,and uh i think that's probably going to be one of our next investments is get her get her a set of clubs and uh we'll get out of the driving range and and get some interest built up and hopefully we can uh we can start in,1,0
sw2331B-ms98-a,51,B,211.377,225.366375,13.989375,oh it i- it's it's a lot of fun e- especially if you can find somebody that's uh that's got the same level of interest that that seems to be the hardest thing well about that- that's that's true of any sport you know if you want to play tennis or,1,0
sw2332A-ms98-a,9,A,28.3355,36.888625,8.553125,and uh when i when i first heard about it i was very uh very defensive i didn't think it was something that that the companies ought to be doing,1,0
sw2332A-ms98-a,24,A,122.230375,129.909,7.678625,uh that we projected that it that it actually cost companies by having people uh uh be involved with drugs,1,0
sw2332A-ms98-a,38,A,192.83775,204.361625,11.523875,yeah the the uh i've always felt that public people who are involved with the safety of other people should be drug tested i've i h- never said that i didn't want that the problem that i had was,1,0
sw2332A-ms98-a,114,A,533.474625,545.188125,11.7135,well i- i- i do i do make that statement i say i do it because_1 i like it but i can't say i'm i'm i'm doing it because_1 i want to i'm doing it because_1 i have to uh or be- my desire is greater than uh ,1,0
sw2332B-ms98-a,120,B,459.849,464.44575,4.59675,it's the honor system i know it'll be an interesting experiment to see how,1,0
sw2332B-ms98-a,125,B,473.63925,477.207,3.56775,personally it you know that that would probably be the next,1,0
sw2333A-ms98-a,30,A,91.076875,95.505875,4.429,it's just that you know i mean if you took all the people out of the state it would be a great place,1,0
sw2333A-ms98-a,52,A,163.5405,172.2575,8.717,i don't i don't know what's i mean public education is just going down the tubes i mean they're throwing more and more money at it and it just seems to be getting worse and worse,1,0
sw2333A-ms98-a,63,A,212.51575,224.669,12.15325,it it must be i bet you know i- i i'm not knocking the garbage men i mean they're necessary but there's a lot of unemployed people out there who would gladly take jobs as garbage men rate for less money,1,0
sw2333A-ms98-a,155,A,548.540125,552.136625,3.5965,all those neat little places that's where i really wanted to be,1,0
sw2333B-ms98-a,59,B,209.334875,213.776875,4.442,that that that must be the rationale for for where it comes from United States,1,0
sw2334A-ms98-a,104,A,384.289625,390.303125,6.0135,they they used to be but they've gotten they've got to pay for all that national advertising now,1,0
sw2334A-ms98-a,108,A,396.704625,402.596375,5.89175,they uh th- they used to be good i remember when they first opened up they did have good bargains,1,0
sw2334A-ms98-a,110,A,409.020125,414.28525,5.265125,yo- you got Service Merchandise yeah it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go,1,0
sw2334A-ms98-a,149,A,533.63825,537.691625,4.053375,they might be but not at not at the human factors level ,1,0
sw2334B-ms98-a,101,B,445.241875,448.448125,3.20625,we could be just lifelong students,1,0
sw2335A-ms98-a,147,A,423.2235,426.986,3.7625,i don't think there's anywhere where there isn't gonna be crime so,1,0
sw2335B-ms98-a,19,B,79.45825,82.246875,2.788625,you can't make parents be parents ,1,0
sw2335B-ms98-a,36,B,162.80425,165.927,3.12275,you know but i'm sure there's something can be done,1,0
sw2335B-ms98-a,54,B,259.567,265.57425,6.00725,i don't know them people boy they got th- i think the United States has got too many problems to be worried about everybody else,1,0
sw2335B-ms98-a,71,B,320.519125,329.13725,8.618125,because   they take and Uncle Sam takes his the Social Security which probably won't be here when i get that old you know,1,0
sw2336A-ms98-a,20,A,78.038375,90.2565,12.218125,But even though i love the car i've got now i think my next car will probably be American again because if i can at all do it i'd like to stay American i always have up until now i just for one time decided to go outside So,1,0
sw2336A-ms98-a,57,A,293.188375,300.53225,7.343875, So the only thing that that would um get me to change cars right now would be if see at the moment i'm single ,1,0
sw2336B-ms98-a,7,B,27.156125,30.9715,3.815375,it's everything it's supposed to be uh i haven't had,1,0
sw2336B-ms98-a,12,B,50.647625,59.924,9.276375,but i would my my criteria would be at the moment it would be uh American uh personally,2,0
sw2336B-ms98-a,25,B,107.544875,112.097875,4.553,opt for uh something that would be,1,0
sw2336B-ms98-a,51,B,266.023625,269.03125,3.007625,not really be tired in any way,1,0
sw2337A-ms98-a,47,A,205.015125,212.705625,7.6905,the ini- in the initial stages of anything no matter even if it is something that ultimately will be simpler are going to be confusing,2,0
sw2337A-ms98-a,61,A,280.5195,285.8985,5.379,right  right that may be true also i don't know chemists seem to,1,0
sw2337A-ms98-a,66,A,292.893625,305.588625,12.695,i mean can you imagine how ridiculous it would be to try to do calc- i mean it boggles the mind to try to think to do all the chemistry or physics in the English system at this point although gosh all those,1,0
sw2337B-ms98-a,35,B,224.76325,234.163125,9.399875,uh i think uh there's a gigantic psychological barrier which may be a worse barrier than the old tool and die uh dimension in English,1,0
sw2337B-ms98-a,36,B,234.163125,245.06675,10.903625,uh and i think that the uh the ultimate solution will be to start introducing it uh in at at the introduction to school,1,0
sw2337B-ms98-a,80,B,555.607125,563.502,7.894875,it's going to be a big psychological barrier and i don't think that we can educate kids all the way to their adulthood and then introduce it to them,1,0
sw2338A-ms98-a,49,A,266.8015,270.618875,3.817375,i don't think it's the kind of thing for anybody i know i wouldn't be able to watch it,1,0

sw2338B-ms98-a,62,B,279.924125,283.590875,3.66675,so that has to be brought into the picture too,1,0
sw2338B-ms98-a,91,B,401.280375,413.12825,11.847875,and some and the circumstances uh may be molded to blame somebody who didn't do it and especially if it's you know somebody who's mentally retarded who can't defend themselves very well,1,0

sw2339A-ms98-a,141,A,427.9405,432.15125,4.21075,that can be a mess we camped at the beach one time and that was sort of miserable,1,0
sw2339B-ms98-a,36,B,134.77075,138.202875,3.432125,and a pool to go to that would be nice ,1,0
sw2339B-ms98-a,93,B,331.70225,334.3595,2.65725,i think this must be into my third week too,1,0
sw2339B-ms98-a,106,B,365.34275,367.52925,2.1865,i wonder if these are going to be speaking,1,0
sw2340A-ms98-a,43,A,182.43,185.956625,3.526625,oh that would be awful i never thought about that you know,1,0
sw2340A-ms98-a,68,A,355.948125,363.107,7.158875,and it seemed like there several people that i knew that had their uh parents i guess they would be but well in their seventy living with them_1,1,0

sw2340B-ms98-a,63,B,202.912,205.716125,2.804125,that would be a tough tough decision,1,0
sw2340B-ms98-a,107,B,393.302125,402.48,9.177875,that my fa- my husband's father is really old he he had him late in life and he's he'll be eighty this year,1,0
sw2340B-ms98-a,145,B,503.41975,516.8795,13.45975,i know bless their hearts you hate to hurt them_1 by doing that that's like their one last thing that they can still do and you take away that driving ability and  that would really be hard we've ,1,0
sw2340B-ms98-a,156,B,554.147125,560.723625,6.5765,they um you know they're testing that they're you know thinking of doing that and i think that'd be a great idea because,1,0
sw2341A-ms98-a,15,A,88.01375,91.03425,3.0205,desire that that money not be spent well,1,0

sw2341A-ms98-a,48,A,294.865375,297.1445,2.279125,it does seem to be the case,1,0
sw2341A-ms98-a,53,A,322.87225,331.71775,8.8455,just uh generally wanting to be in control of of where everything's going for the most part give you the best break if you go their direction,1,0
sw2341A-ms98-a,55,A,334.892875,344.248125,9.35525,uh got rid of some of those controls and just went to what some people would say would be simpler of just having uh you spend this much,1,0
sw2341A-ms98-a,56,A,344.248125,350.451,6.202875,uh therefore you should be taxed this much uh that would only encourage saving it's not a ,1,0
sw2341A-ms98-a,64,A,387.97525,391.247375,3.272125,yeah but you wouldn't be able to steer people toward,1,0
sw2341A-ms98-a,65,A,391.247375,396.624625,5.37725,a particular type of savings you wouldn't be able to say well you get better tax bonds if you you know,1,0
sw2341A-ms98-a,67,A,402.308375,407.368375,5.06,you wouldn't be able to steer people toward retirement and all that but boy if you save that much money,1,0

sw2341B-ms98-a,24,B,174.1535,184.39325,10.23975,and i- i think the things that they use as a basis for distributing back the tax dollars needs to be looked at again,1,0
sw2341B-ms98-a,26,B,195.876,203.05,7.174,i know that would be a a definite B V R M I R ,1,0
sw2341B-ms98-a,41,B,380.33175,388.50725,8.1755,and that makes sense but like you said i mean it it seems simple and i think in a way it's so simple that people would be afraid to try it,1,0
sw2341B-ms98-a,46,B,418.440875,420.949625,2.50875,yo- you'd still be ahead,1,0
sw2341B-ms98-a,49,B,427.814625,432.810125,4.9955,under the current structure what is the best thing to be investing in for the future,1,0
sw2341B-ms98-a,50,B,432.810125,438.273625,5.4635,because that's a that's a scary thought you always hear that Social Security won't be around by the time,1,0

sw2342A-ms98-a,15,A,89.68375,97.634625,7.950875,well uh i guess it's one of those things that uh if it's going to really promote a lasting peace if there is not going to be a peace,1,0
sw2342B-ms98-a,10,B,63.7015,72.82775,9.12625,that'd be interesting because_1 i um i actually um um i'm i'm i'm Jewish and i'm actually sort of not n- not not not really a Zionist per se you know i'm not ,1,0
sw2342B-ms98-a,13,B,81.974625,90.055,8.080375,and uh you know in some sense m- the moderates may be right they may you know may be it is better if they give up just a little bit just to sort of settle things down,2,0
sw2342B-ms98-a,38,B,219.2375,221.20075,1.96325,it's going to be worse,1,0

sw2344A-ms98-a,18,A,81.44,84.22425,2.78425,but i wonder how much longer they're going to be a them,1,0
sw2344A-ms98-a,25,A,101.5235,108.45375,6.93025,for the sake of uh of of unity against us or something if if if need be but,1,0
sw2344A-ms98-a,43,A,199.686,204.918625,5.232625,the thing about Gorbachev strikes me that he wouldn't be that dumb  i don't know though,1,0
sw2344A-ms98-a,47,A,231.52,233.785875,2.265875,it could be real dangerous,1,0
sw2344A-ms98-a,50,A,243.248375,247.291625,4.04325,yes but wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else,1,0
sw2344A-ms98-a,68,A,322.713,326.08725,3.37425,you know and and that would be all and if we could just do the same thing,1,0
sw2344A-ms98-a,69,A,326.08725,330.203875,4.116625,sort of with with with everybody else i suspect we'd we'd be fine,1,0
sw2344A-ms98-a,80,A,377.3955,384.8,7.4045,this is an an i mean this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us like you said before as well so it'd be interesting to watch,2,0
sw2344A-ms98-a,87,A,428.0895,430.085125,1.995625,you be this way,1,0
sw2344A-ms98-a,113,A,560.2175,566.713,6.4955,you can't take a whole bunch of people who just aren't the same people and don't want to be together and put them_1 together forcibly,1,0
sw2344B-ms98-a,32,B,114.542375,127.508375,12.966,things that we have that they're not allowed i mean just some basic freedoms and and their government is not allowing it and Gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying to push,1,0
sw2344B-ms98-a,45,B,204.535125,210.192875,5.65775,i don't know i mean and it it might be something that he wouldn't be able to control,2,0
sw2344B-ms98-a,121,B,589.540375,598.588375,9.048,they they they might the the Baltic States might be feeling the same way that our forefathers felt when they were leaving to come here,1,0
sw2345A-ms98-a,17,A,102.2515,109.407,7.1555,that sounds like the city i worked for the city of Dallas for a while and i do know that they're they can be really ,1,0
sw2345A-ms98-a,25,A,151.5385,159.964875,8.426375,put my driver's license number on it ugly too i mean where it could be seen because_1 i don't care d- i just don't want them_1 to get it and hock it again,1,0
sw2345B-ms98-a,66,B,326.22075,334.149625,7.928875,but i mean the people that are i'd be curious to if the people that are wouldn't you think the people that are breaking in are probably,1,0
sw2345B-ms98-a,68,B,340.375625,352.79225,12.416625,i should think that'd be more than  a lot more than just ordinary recreation it would be interesting to see if to the problem is is is what do you lock them_1 up for you know,2,0
sw2345B-ms98-a,80,B,410.38725,418.117625,7.730375,how should he you know what bothers me is the incentive that he's if you if you know you're going to be in there for life why should you just be good,2,0
sw2345B-ms98-a,82,B,428.97725,441.768,12.79075,i i guess the problem is is is what it would take to do that would be more money than we it's like the school issue and which i guess   supposed to talk to but anyway the idea of how much money would it take to reform these criminals and lock them_1 all up,1,0
sw2345B-ms98-a,108,B,557.108375,560.88175,3.773375,well how would they know i mean they they'd have to be pretty sophisticated,1,0
sw2346A-ms98-a,41,A,203.62225,207.48475,3.8625,and it lived to be a a pretty old bird,1,0
sw2346A-ms98-a,45,A,222.320875,227.17175,4.850875,and they don't seem to be as healthy as uh one's you get from uh breeders,1,0
sw2346B-ms98-a,41,B,227.5525,234.103875,6.551375,you might check uh some of the ads in the paper and see if anybody has an aviary that you might be able to buy from there,1,0
sw2346B-ms98-a,42,B,234.103875,242.686625,8.58275,that seems to be an up and coming business i know out there where we are there's there's uh a person on each side of our,1,0
sw2346B-ms98-a,52,B,295.32675,301.195875,5.869125,and she ought to be due sometime toward the end of this week on a litter we just got her,1,0
sw2347A-ms98-a,12,A,154.714375,162.41975,7.705375,yes and and i have no problem with that but i think the male needs to be the dominant person,1,0
sw2347A-ms98-a,15,A,180.344125,188.68075,8.336625,and they have to be in charge and and i th- i think they lose a lot by what i call neutering their husbands,1,0
sw2347A-ms98-a,43,A,401.737625,409.405,7.667375,uh i didn't realize it but i sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only and here's this young girl,1,0
sw2347A-ms98-a,49,A,440.312625,451.09525,10.782625,he's a very considerate person but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and and in the home and she should vote but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote,1,0
sw2347B-ms98-a,8,B,42.843125,56.029,13.185875,um that it makes it uh sometimes it makes life more difficult i think when the roles now are less defined as far as you know what uh women should or should not be doing that,1,0
sw2347B-ms98-a,12,B,89.803375,102.4275,12.624125,so um have you have you worked outside also and um feel that it that well how do you feel as far as uh what would be a happy medium or or what would you like to see,1,0
sw2347B-ms98-a,28,B,153.258625,155.779,2.520375,oh i be- i think so yes ,1,0
sw2347B-ms98-a,43,B,233.840375,247.673625,13.83325,they used to look down on women that were home they'd say oh i bet you go home and you know at least you get out of here at three and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas and i used to be infuriated because they really had no idea,1,0
sw2347B-ms98-a,101,B,490.15875,503.742,13.58325,and i think it gets scary for them to see change also they've been used to being really to be honest in in society and in a way number one and they come home and everything's done for them and their meal is served,1,0
sw2347B-ms98-a,106,B,535.484375,546.829875,11.3455,um if that meant you know for me to be able to uh uh advance or go back to work or whatever i'm kind of more  thank you  i'm kind of more middle,1,0
sw2347B-ms98-a,107,B,546.829875,555.173,8.343125,of the road i think that when children are small i think it's okay for women to work especially there should be some a lot more part time,1,0
sw2347B-ms98-a,111,B,577.676875,588.985125,11.30825,i think you have to put in perspective that you know when the kids came home from school i wanted to be here i didn't want i don't want a job where i'm traveling around and an- i'm away and uh,1,0
sw2348A-ms98-a,109,A,514.317125,518.95675,4.639625,you know and i'm sure it must be prevalent in your area down in Dallas,1,0
sw2349A-ms98-a,9,A,25.93325,30.322875,4.389625,yeah prob- you're probably right yeah two years is might be a little too long,1,0
sw2349A-ms98-a,12,A,38.03125,40.241375,2.210125,that would be the problem,1,0
sw2349A-ms98-a,21,A,58.3445,66.988,8.6435,i'm not sure they need to be you know paid you know a super do salary of any kind that that kind of takes away from public service,1,0
sw2349A-ms98-a,23,A,69.856375,79.30125,9.444875,but just you know to receive a letter in the mail that says you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday you know i'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea,1,0
sw2349A-ms98-a,35,A,112.348875,119.151,6.802125,um-hum sure would there would have to be a lot of you know thought given to something like that i would think,1,0
sw2349A-ms98-a,71,A,201.384625,208.668875,7.28425,but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information uh you know disseminated before you say let's do this you know,1,0
sw2349A-ms98-a,90,A,248.87175,256.88475,8.013,and i guess even back to Kennedy as a matter of f- i guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was it you know really interested in things like that,1,0

sw2349B-ms98-a,36,B,174.985375,182.13725,7.151875, but they would have to be supportive in some way and i'm not sure those those programs are available to do that,1,0

sw2363A-ms98-a,85,A,364.145125,377.922,13.776875,don't know what y'all are going through to be honest with you to sit there in option one and approve everybody's time i didn't do it before and i don't do it now so i don't have anything to compare that with for us in communicating with peo- with everybody,1,0
sw2363A-ms98-a,86,A,377.922,392.29775,14.37575,and and being able to see what you are doing and everything it's really been a a a godsend it's been wonderful getting everybody on the same system it's been great and an easy system that everybody seems to be able to learn you know it's been really good,1,0
sw2363A-ms98-a,96,A,461.543625,474.3495,12.805875,so but that's just from my point of view like i said i don't have to sit down and de- depending on how many work rooms you have and everything you know it could be a real problem maybe to approve everybody ,1,0
sw2363A-ms98-a,112,A,535.36525,546.959375,11.594125,was that all i have to do it you know  there's got to be something else i have to do and i'm no it's just really easy and setting up your own cost your own uh work groups now too where as we had to do it before,1,0
sw2363B-ms98-a,36,B,146.809625,148.8665,2.056875, be kind of like,1,0
sw2363B-ms98-a,88,B,300.98,305.8075,4.8275,it it could probably be corrected easily i don't know if anybody's  about it or not,1,0
sw2363B-ms98-a,144,B,490.851875,496.6125,5.760625,yeah working with it it's uh you can see some areas that could be improved,1,0
sw2365A-ms98-a,58,A,342.494875,356.479,13.984125,and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't uh the mold everything is white in a new house everything is white ,1,0
sw2365B-ms98-a,28,B,178.775125,186.296,7.520875,that the house be painted before we bought it and it was fairly reasonable we have a brick house but all the trim,1,0
sw2366A-ms98-a,15,A,145.821125,158.322375,12.50125,it's something that interests me uh combined with with the classical tastes i had mentioned and my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds early eighteen hundred,1,0
sw2366A-ms98-a,26,A,199.5655,209.8505,10.285,uh and and begin to reacquire skills i inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a for a new piano player,1,0
sw2366A-ms98-a,33,A,318.140125,328.001375,9.86125,uh a good example would be uh i have connections but but uh not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations,1,0
sw2366A-ms98-a,38,A,358.67125,361.68225,3.011,that could well be i i uh,1,0
sw2366A-ms98-a,61,A,435.126125,445.74125,10.615125,i always think that i'll be able to do it and then i inevitably discover that i have no innate  music talent relative to composition and that i struggle and really can't quite understand what it is that other people take for granted ,1,0
sw2366A-ms98-a,63,A,456.7555,471.393125,14.637625,uh but in a in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude and i keep thinking gee i thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand but it doesn't for me,1,0
sw2366B-ms98-a,6,B,36.084875,45.621125,9.53625,i'm not quite sure why that is and it seems like almost a an opposite but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pop,1,0
sw2367A-ms98-a,69,A,274.125625,280.4215,6.295875,but uh i'm going to be starting working full time this summer so maybe maybe my restaurants will change,1,0
sw2367A-ms98-a,93,A,353.359875,358.098,4.738125,i used to just i i used be a connoisseur of hamburger ,1,0
sw2367B-ms98-a,24,B,141.987,154.45825,12.47125,it's like a mystery uh theater uh that you you know you eat dinner and all through dinner they're they're doing this act and they they get supposedly get the uh the audience involved in it and everything and that that sounds like that would be hilarious you know ,1,0
sw2367B-ms98-a,27,B,170.155625,179.176125,9.0205,that aren't you know what i mean um predictable exactly but i mean you know the the dinner a dinner theater like this ought to be just wild i don't know,1,0
sw2368A-ms98-a,79,A,314.521,322.107625,7.586625,yeah that's true especially well well TI is like anybody else you never know how long you're going to be here or be in one place you know,2,0
sw2368A-ms98-a,134,A,498.654875,503.463125,4.80825,uh it's not as bad as i remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be,1,0
sw2368A-ms98-a,135,A,503.463125,516.46625,13.003125,uh there seems to be a a more a mature crowd in uh apartments at least where i am uh even though you know there's kids all around and there's there's traffic and there's people going up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that but still uh,1,0
sw2368B-ms98-a,63,B,282.5735,294.019375,11.445875,that's exactly uh growing i grew up in western Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh and uh we used to call the basements actual cellars so it's funny to hear that word because_1 i never hear it you know it's like the back porch used to be a stoop you know,1,0
sw2368B-ms98-a,93,B,418.92625,429.634375,10.708125,getting to agree to things that i'm sure and i also think that once you get to be um you know certain when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit  ,3,0
sw2369A-ms98-a,33,A,132.794875,142.81275,10.017875,yeah well  a lot of my camping was up in the Arbuckles as i was growing up there's a place that used to be called Platte National Park up around Sulphur and Davis and and not too far from Turner Falls ,1,0
sw2369A-ms98-a,50,A,246.044,248.518875,2.474875,well that would be great there pretty co-,1,0
sw2369A-ms98-a,67,A,307.393,312.56825,5.17525,that's great i'd forgotten all about the Texan side and that's but you got to be a member of Texans to use it,1,0
sw2369B-ms98-a,59,B,311.64,319.6845,8.0445,yeah yeah you you've got to be a a a Texas member but if you are a master member of Texans the the membership to Texoma is free ,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,7,A,44.204,57.68,13.476,yes there was not there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the the bathroom floors be on any given day,2,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,9,A,58.769875,63.384125,4.61425,and then of course today it's supposed to be all the other way you're supposed to only want the job,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,10,A,63.384125,71.42675,8.042625,and and uh your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care and and we have these wonderful people who are,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,29,A,154.31575,166.9845,12.66875,yeah and so it was in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,32,A,176.623,185.67475,9.05175,i have i have branched out i was a photographer before but when i went to college it was i felt like i couldn't support myself if i decided to be a photographer,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,33,A,185.67475,192.9555,7.28075,that it would just have to be a hobby and i'm i'm very mechanical and mechanical engineering interested me so i did that and then i you know i did that for six years,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,51,A,261.49975,271.468125,9.968375,ten year- even in the even now they're starting to do it but i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there's going to be a lot of women and they're going to have to work it out to working part time,2,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,54,A,278.73475,290.3195,11.58475,i might still be working basically full time or part time if there was if there had been some way to work it out because i liked my job really well but i was just pulled in so many different directions i was it was just driving me crazy,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,57,A,311.40025,317.57425,6.174,can be in day care for a few hours a week or my husband if it's you know an- an- when he's at home can take care of them,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,60,A,324.519125,326.37425,1.855125,it's going to have to be both,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,67,A,376.481625,389.1165,12.634875,and even though we were both working the same number of hours and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done this is what you do it now  ,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,73,A,416.53375,426.75625,10.2225,and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be do- this is the time this needs to be done but,2,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,84,A,445.045125,454.937,9.891875,and i think that's that's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls it's not they're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,85,A,454.937,461.5895,6.6525,this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know you both got to they were both working at whatever things were,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,86,A,461.5895,470.6645,9.075,needed to be done they're going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be cleaned,3,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,91,A,494.124875,499.057375,4.9325, yeah the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases young college,1,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,99,A,522.059875,531.47775,9.417875,and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little,2,0
sw2370A-ms98-a,100,A,531.47775,545.072875,13.595125,you know this is the way i feel about this and this is the way because_1 i it's you know when you when you if you if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you just you add onto it as they get older,1,0
sw2370B-ms98-a,33,B,129.99175,144.21925,14.2275,so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer you know the technicians work the eight to five job and and know when they're going to be there,1,0
sw2370B-ms98-a,34,B,144.21925,147.69475,3.4755,but uh if you're going to be more pro- professional oriented,1,0
sw2370B-ms98-a,35,B,147.69475,152.60975,4.915,then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that,1,0
sw2370B-ms98-a,50,B,201.107125,205.599625,4.4925,yeah i mean you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child,1,0
sw2370B-ms98-a,59,B,227.7635,232.595375,4.831875,and and they they need that you know to be able to relate to other people besides,1,0
sw2370B-ms98-a,61,B,234.776125,248.78775,14.011625,yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and,1,0
sw2370B-ms98-a,111,B,425.83725,438.014125,12.176875,and a lot of that is is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid which brings us back to the idea you know someone's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in these you know drill in the right ideas,1,0
sw2370B-ms98-a,147,B,581.372375,583.66225,2.289875,yeah the men have to be convinced of that,1,0
sw2371A-ms98-a,24,A,93.220375,96.92825,3.707875,yeah so i like Texas it's a nice place to be,1,0
sw2371A-ms98-a,26,A,102.08875,110.86,8.77125,i would think i don't know might be a little bit different because_1 the city interferes with the weather patterns to a certain extent because_1 of the heating of the of the concrete and asphalt,1,0
sw2371A-ms98-a,47,A,167.0875,178.38,11.2925,in fact last year i was driving home one night and i was listening to some station some radio station in Iowa and uh the uh DJ was saying uh tonight's going to be like eighty below,1,0
sw2371A-ms98-a,84,A,337.015875,347.301875,10.286,and i thought well if i ride my bike the wind chill will be close to zero it will last seven minutes six minutes if i walk it'll be ten degrees warmer but it will last twenty minutes,2,0
sw2371B-ms98-a,25,B,78.16825,85.95325,7.785,i guess  in a way i just i really like the summer like to uh be able to lay out or you know just be outside,2,0
sw2371B-ms98-a,65,B,209.812125,211.555375,1.74325,yeah that would be horrible,1,0
sw2371B-ms98-a,92,B,296.0375,309.3155,13.278,really i guess it wouldn't be bad if you i guess up north it wouldn't be bad to visit we we love to go skiing and um snow it's beautiful when it snows and you have all those pine trees and everything that is pretty but i sure couldn't live there,2,0
sw2372A-ms98-a,64,A,302.297,310.283375,7.986375,so the first thing when i started work at this bank was i said well now first of all we need to all be able to share this PC without getting up ,1,0
sw2372A-ms98-a,104,A,476.757375,484.9165,8.159125,well it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came in and bought up the rival and now N C N B's got a little larger market share ,1,0
sw2372A-ms98-a,113,A,534.5445,542.98825,8.44375,it's just the  department happened to be just a little behind the times because the uh the senior vice president over audits is cheap,1,0
sw2372A-ms98-a,115,A,544.008,555.314875,11.306875,and it's real hard to pry money out of him to to t- do these things but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better and,2,0
sw2372B-ms98-a,120,B,432.3075,440.41775,8.11025,no uh-huh if it was a customer presentation then that would be different we would want to to razzle-dazzle uh but uh ,1,0
sw2373A-ms98-a,15,A,62.94625,66.5295,3.58325,and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all,1,0
sw2373A-ms98-a,17,A,73.36875,79.633125,6.264375,well i think i don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it um,1,0
sw2373A-ms98-a,33,A,148.634125,155.016,6.381875, It would be really nice because i'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes ,1,0
sw2373A-ms98-a,81,A,317.521875,323.098,5.576125,it's not like a mountain it wouldn't be like a mountain it's uh,1,0
sw2373A-ms98-a,117,A,460.50925,469.24775,8.7385,the college without the college here this town would be nothing It would be absolutely dead because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants,2,0
sw2373A-ms98-a,129,A,514.9465,519.492875,4.546375,and um like be their financial advisor or something,1,0
sw2373A-ms98-a,141,A,549.05025,552.577875,3.527625,well well what would be the unemployment rate out there,1,0
sw2373B-ms98-a,18,B,66.492125,68.21575,1.723625,would that be so bad,1,0
sw2373B-ms98-a,41,B,147.5175,148.998875,1.481375,but wouldn't it be wonderful,1,0
sw2373B-ms98-a,132,B,519.144375,522.68825,3.543875,oh that would be great that would be neat,2,0
sw2374A-ms98-a,15,A,65.831875,72.070625,6.23875,but i i i had thought all the way through that UNLV was going to be the team that would just walk away with it,1,0
sw2374A-ms98-a,31,A,132.025125,145.319875,13.29475,yeah so he he's uh he's probably going to be going to jail and and the problem with him is he's on a guaranteed salary like for three years so whether he plays or not they've got to pay him ten million dollars so if they,1,0
sw2374A-ms98-a,52,A,248.306375,262.115375,13.809,and i've i've gone to about three or four of their games and i don't even think he was on the sidelines so i i think he hurt his knee or something but he he definitely didn't turn out to be anything like he was supposed to,1,0
sw2374A-ms98-a,69,A,332.204875,343.046125,10.84125,and uh so now it'd be really to their benefit to to really play uh some bad ball and and hopefully get a lucky uh lottery pick,1,0
sw2374A-ms98-a,82,A,381.656125,389.915375,8.25925,you know if if they could get somebody to help compliment him you know i think they'd be uh awesome because_1 that guy can play,1,0
sw2374A-ms98-a,85,A,394.375875,397.340875,2.965,i don't know it'll it'll be interesting,1,0
sw2374A-ms98-a,112,A,469.94625,474.56175,4.6155,yeah because_1 Ohio State used to be just a perennial powerhouse,1,0
sw2374B-ms98-a,9,B,35.61225,41.065375,5.453125,well i suppose they must be still must be pretty good if they took on UNLV so,2,0
sw2375A-ms98-a,28,A,160.6095,171.399125,10.789625,so he's basically you know what- whatever the computer can do for you fine i'll learn enough to to make it work well for me but i'm not gonna be a guru ,1,0
sw2375B-ms98-a,57,B,253.042125,260.374625,7.3325, i don't know  i know there must be something more i can do  ,1,0
sw2376A-ms98-a,11,A,54.03925,61.20775,7.1685,which would really be handy you know for people like shut ins or people who can't or don't drive you know they can't get to the these centers,1,0
sw2376B-ms98-a,14,B,47.19975,51.04225,3.8425,oh yeah that would be much more convenient yeah,1,0
sw2376B-ms98-a,28,B,98.768,105.4395,6.6715,so they moved it behind the store and nobody knew where it was and so people kept piling stuff in the same place where it used to be,1,0
sw2376B-ms98-a,30,B,113.503875,121.6005,8.096625,so we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly with two little kids and the paper but it just builds up it would be so nice if they had it,1,0
sw2376B-ms98-a,35,B,147.766125,155.881875,8.11575,they'll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city but it's not i think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this and it's not going to be   ,2,0
sw2376B-ms98-a,46,B,193.543,203.394375,9.851375,yeah well they're working on diapers which would be great i've read so many different things about diapers and now their saying that uh originally they thought the disposables were just awful ,1,0
sw2377A-ms98-a,10,A,76.805125,83.58,6.774875,i learned uh to use a rationalized system of measure which turned out to be the metric system,1,0
sw2377A-ms98-a,32,A,281.502125,293.469875,11.96775,you know i think also equally important is that uh it needs to be put into practice in in everyday life we're seeing a little bit of it now that you go out to work on your car and you discover your English wrenches don't fit,1,0
sw2377A-ms98-a,65,A,529.16675,533.7785,4.61175,well we also need to be a little bit careful and maybe we start,1,0
sw2377B-ms98-a,4,B,26.535875,37.736875,11.201,and we uh we were pretty heavily into the metric system and and before we started i just thought oh no i don't want to do this you know this is just going to be so hard and once i really realized how easy it was,1,0
sw2377B-ms98-a,35,B,185.816125,194.267,8.450875,you know it's just not going to happen that way but i do think if they would start with the kids now at you know in you know twenty years from now we could be switched over,1,0
sw2377B-ms98-a,59,B,302.68875,314.06875,11.38,but i i still don't think that they're doing all that it's going to take to make it happen you know it's going to happen slowly no matter what but there's going to have to be a lot more education involved than there is right now to get it to to get it to switch over,1,0
sw2377B-ms98-a,69,B,354.194375,367.877625,13.68325,you know i just when i going into it i just had this block and i went there's just no way i'm going to be able to learn this and when i sat down and really said okay just you know forget your old prejudices and really look at it you know and once you look at it's so really simple you know you,1,0
sw2377B-ms98-a,103,B,553.469625,559.542375,6.07275,right that's going to be hard to do it's going to be very hard to do you know you,2,0
sw2378A-ms98-a,31,A,130.201375,137.214,7.012625,uh they'll somebody be driving along whether they're they're in their early twenty's or or teens,1,0

sw2378B-ms98-a,4,B,15.7005,25.2715,9.571,uh where you see armed robbery and and uh rape and murder you know are starting to be a lot more prevalent in this area,1,0
sw2378B-ms98-a,75,B,314.15525,327.76125,13.606,and um yeah Dallas is you know you can see some economic turnarounds but uh and i don't think it will ever be back to what it was because it was you know it was really blowing and going there for a while,1,0
sw2378B-ms98-a,94,B,388.089,393.437625,5.348625,but you know the violent crime is is uh definitely something's got to be done on that,1,0
sw2378B-ms98-a,114,B,442.709375,451.181625,8.47225,well see i'm not either because i'm i'm really not for higher taxes you know to go out and pay for uh more people to be out on the street,1,0
sw2379A-ms98-a,73,A,301.6195,308.79175,7.17225,and losing it in the competitive market and a real knowl- uh a lack of understanding how that could be,1,0
sw2379A-ms98-a,78,A,329.179125,342.839625,13.6605,and sense of corporate respons- increased corporate responsible towards uh you know environmental safety and things like that and that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the Civil Rights Act in in the near future,1,0
sw2379A-ms98-a,100,A,452.13675,466.75225,14.6155,and that's a real change except it sort of brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything   i mean all this recycling used to be in tact or not all of it but much of it did i mean recycling was a was a wartime thing,1,0
sw2379B-ms98-a,14,B,71.4875,81.5695,10.082, if you wanted to get ahead with the company well if you were a uh black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months if you were white male you're talking six years,1,0
sw2379B-ms98-a,19,B,107.656,121.60075,13.94475,and uh  it's i think they're they're like all companies well represented and uh you know everything seems to be fine i i've kind of lost touch with the company we had a falling out but uh,1,0
sw2379B-ms98-a,24,B,137.725,139.873,2.148,people seem to be more,1,0
sw2379B-ms98-a,48,B,381.24075,389.59675,8.356,there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone i mean you know ,1,0
sw2379B-ms98-a,51,B,401.9415,412.6065,10.665,and the problem is that ideally you they you know the world would like you to be completely indifferent so um but i- i i understand what you say about the environmental movement um,1,0
sw2380A-ms98-a,14,A,80.654625,88.558,7.903375,yeah oh boy or uh or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury,2,0
sw2380A-ms98-a,20,A,125.161125,131.790375,6.62925,now the one thing i did approve of there was that we didn't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case,1,0
sw2380A-ms98-a,37,A,262.107875,275.677125,13.56925,and yeah i think that was just a a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the uh you know staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury,1,0
sw2380A-ms98-a,60,A,453.737125,456.022125,2.285,yeah that would be helpful,1,0
sw2380A-ms98-a,68,A,492.87475,495.63,2.75525,and you think that would be relevant,1,0
sw2380A-ms98-a,80,A,545.1615,553.2205,8.059,yeah that's something i thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen,1,0
sw2380B-ms98-a,7,B,30.44325,39.734,9.29075,and it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just you know happen to be selected in our jury to understand what we're talking about,1,0
sw2380B-ms98-a,32,B,152.983125,166.250875,13.26775,but i know that um for a lot of the civil cases it's rare i mean if your a lawyer um there you could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the  there's a lot of attorneys like that that never get to the courtroom,1,0
sw2380B-ms98-a,57,B,332.65,341.422375,8.772375,if he breaks law especially it he's a repeater the law shouldn't just always cover for him that some of his rights as should be taken  ,1,0

sw2389A-ms98-a,58,A,247.551625,250.237875,2.68625,or they won't be as good as they could be,2,0
sw2389A-ms98-a,131,A,522.654,528.94725,6.29325,actually i think abortion's going to take a turn where there's not going to be as many,1,0
sw2389A-ms98-a,132,A,528.94725,537.084625,8.137375,because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular i mean i realize that they are popular now but i think,1,0
sw2389A-ms98-a,134,A,543.502375,553.98425,10.481875,i i don't think there's going to be many abortions but i don't know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion,1,0
sw2389A-ms98-a,135,A,553.98425,557.101375,3.117125,i think it'll be freedom of choice,1,0
sw2389A-ms98-a,143,A,571.384375,578.825625,7.44125,i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics i d- i think it'll definitely be freedom of choice,1,0
sw2389B-ms98-a,9,B,38.679375,51.520625,12.84125,you know that's on the board of directors or that type of thing they're mostly all men there there may be a few but very incidental  and uh i i really think that it'll be a long time probably before we see that,2,0
sw2389B-ms98-a,14,B,72.31175,83.255375,10.943625,y- you know it's it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living and i don't think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff,1,0
sw2389B-ms98-a,26,B,166.542,171.82575,5.28375,you know i'm not saying that that it's totally gone but it's nothing like what it used to be,1,0
sw2389B-ms98-a,36,B,232.70275,242.167125,9.464375,that's fine that that's the freedom of choice and i i agree with that because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent,1,0
sw2389B-ms98-a,37,B,242.167125,249.75325,7.586125,uh well i shouldn't say they're not going to be a good parent they won't be a caring parent like they won't have that uh,2,0

sw2389B-ms98-a,52,B,317.169,330.965875,13.796875,you know and i feel that's very important it really is and it's too bad be- because mothers miss out on so much too so i mean in the sense that uh we've come a long way yes but we've sacrificed a lot to get there ,1,0
sw2389B-ms98-a,54,B,341.141625,345.289875,4.14825,but then it got to be a point where they got some independence,1,0

sw2389B-ms98-a,82,B,480.7655,492.66375,11.89825,and that's what i say y- you'll b- you'll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it's because you've been there,1,0
sw2389B-ms98-a,100,B,579.54,581.937625,2.397625,which i mean i think it should be anyway,1,0

sw2390A-ms98-a,102,A,493.4495,499.802,6.3525,i wonder how much is numbers how many billions of dollars it's got to be billions of dollars,1,0
sw2392A-ms98-a,20,A,96.658875,105.0175,8.358625,usually i like to go just to get the kids out have them_1 in a confined space where i can uh sit down and relax and be able to watch them_1 too,1,0

sw2393B-ms98-a,57,B,313.713625,322.966875,9.25325,that was the only thing i didn't like about lawns and we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out,1,0
sw2393B-ms98-a,99,B,555.919875,562.551625,6.63175,but that's so neat because so many homes don't have that so you'll be cool all year around in the summer that's great,1,0

sw2417A-ms98-a,11,A,86.64475,89.8455,3.20075,would be just you know it's like you know,1,0
sw2417A-ms98-a,12,A,89.8455,99.57175,9.72625,yeah i mean you wouldn't you wouldn't do it i mean  the the the thing would be that it would throw you you know totally the wrong way you would be there because you had to be there,3,0
sw2417A-ms98-a,21,A,157.23225,163.907375,6.675125,to to actually support it you know it would be just like saying that you know what a- what are you crazy i mean there,1,0
sw2417A-ms98-a,49,A,353.49775,367.39225,13.8945,you know but that's what they do i mean that's a year and a half of your life that's that you don't do anything that you have to be there you know maybe five times you know five times a week and that you know that you have a i guess a round robin schedule or something,1,0
sw2417A-ms98-a,55,A,396.714625,406.69875,9.984125,and uh you know it's like they they consider that but it would be the same way here you know it's like i- if you had to do it you know you have a big sign i'm sorry i don't get paid you ,1,0
sw2417A-ms98-a,60,A,426.2675,431.541125,5.273625,and so that would be that would be see there're too many things that go against it that would be ridiculous,3,0
sw2417A-ms98-a,65,A,449.86025,459.402125,9.541875,and but then you won't have to do it just imagine sometimes your kids you'll be saying well it's your job go do it you know  but i-  ,1,0
sw2417B-ms98-a,5,B,25.9975,35.88275,9.88525,sort of like the draft do you know in the Army you're not going to uh uh be i i u- i understand what you're saying i'm i'm twenty four and uh,1,0
sw2417B-ms98-a,6,B,35.88275,42.831,6.94825,you know i i don't think that i would be willing to to dedicate you know a year or two years of my life,1,0
sw2417B-ms98-a,35,B,154.280375,159.241,4.960625,that would be political suicide for anybody to i would think,1,0
sw2418A-ms98-a,12,A,51.462375,62.710875,11.2485,oh yeah it's uh that's the finances i guess we're on the subject of finances it is tough uh i've been with TI i'm just going to be fifteen years this year and that's a tough thing uh,1,0
sw2418A-ms98-a,19,A,97.97875,110.970125,12.991375,well i guess i do i do have a long term budget bec- i got a daughter in college and one going to be in college so that i've been thinking about that for quite a while now mo- monthly no i'll tell you a funny story about budgeting uh,1,0
sw2418A-ms98-a,30,A,191.460625,196.996375,5.53575,yes i think uh that is a tough uh we all seems to th- seems to be that way,1,0
sw2418A-ms98-a,37,A,234.4965,244.982375,10.485875,listen to Bruce Williams uh for financial advice he's on oh i don't know what he's going to be in Austin he's on five seventy here inter- oh he's nationally famous,1,0
sw2418A-ms98-a,40,A,260.455125,272.719625,12.2645,he's on national radio uh i don't know what it would be down there you might want to whatever your radio talk shows are down there he's on that channel it's uh it's five seventy up here,1,0
sw2418A-ms98-a,49,A,350.211375,361.72075,11.509375,oh no yeah right they give us ten minutes uh uh the only advice i give you on college would be there's a lot of scholarship money out there my daughter got a little bit not much only first year she got about two thousand dollars worth,1,0
sw2418A-ms98-a,70,A,497.777125,507.46025,9.683125,uh it beats being laid off and everything and uh you you got to be a little flexible uh in my old age i'm trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school,1,0
sw2418B-ms98-a,9,B,32.748875,43.494875,10.746,oh no no no no  actually i left TI um i had basically set my sights to leave TI when they announced there would be no salary increases in ninety one,1,0
sw2418B-ms98-a,27,B,162.522,176.287,13.765,basically good with money it i don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it i think that comes from never having enough you know i'm always afraid of  i'm going to need some and where will it be ,1,0
sw2418B-ms98-a,51,B,314.989,319.97025,4.98125,excuse me Jim could you hold on i have someone at the door i'll be right back,1,0
sw2418B-ms98-a,64,B,424.70525,430.394125,5.688875,wow oh i'm definitely going to be uh actively looking into that,1,0
sw2418B-ms98-a,81,B,522.824625,536.975,14.150375,a stay at home mom and and i i  was very fortunate in starting and i really enjoyed it while i was at TI but you know the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening and i had less than five years,1,0
sw2419A-ms98-a,10,A,20.300625,28.79025,8.489625,yeah they really uh uh they found out that all the guys that were backing up uh McMahon when they got to be the first guys weren't all that good after all,1,0
sw2419A-ms98-a,100,A,497.43575,508.1095,10.67375,and we just ended up taking the neighbors kids who were teenagers because our i thought that ultimately my own would want to go and the way the stadium was selling out in season tickets it might be totally sold out which it never did,1,0
sw2419B-ms98-a,21,B,69.656125,72.319375,2.66325,i think he'll be okay once he gets on ,1,0
sw2419B-ms98-a,77,B,392.31725,398.189875,5.872625,i'll be interested to see how they do of course actually i was in Dallas in of course i worked for TI too for a while,1,0
sw2419B-ms98-a,94,B,473.312375,484.335125,11.02275,but uh every time the kids didn't go we'd go and we'd go out there and just you know at at like ten o'clock in the morning and set up and there would be all these people gathered around that you know all the tailgaters and stuff,1,0
sw2419B-ms98-a,116,B,586.360375,592.044625,5.68425,i kind of wonder you know gosh if i could sit on the bench and earn five hundred thousand dollars a year i'd just be happy to sit there,1,0
sw2420B-ms98-a,76,B,272.5045,277.099625,4.595125,i just wish something else could be done in this country i don't know what,1,0
sw2421A-ms98-a,9,A,46.907875,60.494875,13.587,um see i have to take uh medication for a uh for for kidney transplant and i'm going to be taking that the rest of my life now you i don't know how that's going to affect uh,1,0
sw2421A-ms98-a,30,A,203.07825,209.788,6.70975,and it takes some drastic steps at this point and i think personally the drastic step has to be,1,0
sw2421A-ms98-a,51,A,329.429,334.536875,5.107875,well then let's let's answer the second half of the question what limits ought to be put on it do you think,1,0
sw2421A-ms98-a,67,A,424.531375,429.6835,5.152125,personally i think that's what i was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested,1,0
sw2421A-ms98-a,72,A,454.886,459.450125,4.564125,well there's yeah there there's going to be some measure of incentive,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,22,B,79.95675,91.241125,11.284375,checked out or whatever i but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that um i agree that that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test ,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,23,B,91.241125,100.243125,9.002,but i would think that um that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that for example that one uh positive,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,24,B,100.243125,105.030625,4.7875,would not be uh accepted as an automatic um,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,25,B,105.030625,111.6665,6.635875,reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive uh dismissal or treatment or whatever ,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,26,B,111.6665,120.135125,8.468625,but that that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps uh one or two more stages where further tests could be ta- uh done,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,27,B,120.135125,132.6915,12.556375,because um there are there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with with uh false positives for certain kind of drugs on the other hand um,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,28,B,132.6915,136.971125,4.279625,i think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,31,B,159.3655,165.296875,5.931375,depending on the kind of drug he might be on but um and eventually that's going to show up anyway,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,53,B,265.17875,274.003125,8.824375,the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking and he may never really be,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,54,B,274.003125,281.504375,7.50125,a productive member of society But sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,63,B,334.512375,343.140875,8.6285,well the limits uh uh would i think have to do with what i'd alluded to before that there needs to be a further um,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,66,B,353.30925,359.850375,6.541125,uh have set up for those who genuinely have a problem in other words there needs to be um more than,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,67,B,359.850375,365.6045,5.754125,pard- yes right there needs to be more than one test and there needs to be some,2,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,69,B,375.521625,384.1545,8.632875,uh you know denial of insurance for someone um and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this um,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,70,B,384.1545,390.5525,6.398,that would that you know it would be unfair and people who are on medication for example or um,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,71,B,390.5525,399.61225,9.05975,e- even people who might be of the gay community and i'm not an advocate for that particular  segment of society but um i think that,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,72,B,399.61225,405.822,6.20975,there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination because it makes a bigger problem,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,73,B,405.822,414.134625,8.312625,um so it seems to me that that um there needs to be some ground you know some rules that protect,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,74,B,414.134625,424.32775,10.193125,i'm not sure though when we talk about what rules if any that we should say well certain segments should not have to be tested i really don't see why,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,79,B,429.381375,433.899875,4.5185,yeah i don't i don't know why it would be you know um,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,80,B,433.899875,442.537375,8.6375,bad to test just every- and it may be you know it's not feasible to do everyone but certainly random testing the fact that people know that that they,1,0
sw2421B-ms98-a,81,B,442.537375,451.110625,8.57325,yeah would be some measure of protection but the bottom line is that that if if you're going to     then um,1,0
sw2422A-ms98-a,79,A,318.2985,325.030875,6.732375,and uh i sometimes i may not be conscious of keeping count but uh,1,0
sw2422A-ms98-a,120,A,495.439125,499.182625,3.7435,uh the one we thought would be the most timid,1,0
sw2422A-ms98-a,121,A,499.182625,503.791125,4.6085,uh turned out to be the one that stuck with it and was the first to learn,1,0
sw2422B-ms98-a,68,B,252.335125,256.22775,3.892625,and you'd be surprised how quick that gets the pulse rate up,1,0
sw2422B-ms98-a,76,B,287.9795,291.504625,3.525125,oh but that wouldn't be boring like walking up stairs ,1,0
sw2423A-ms98-a,7,A,29.91125,35.47525,5.564,um it doesn't really have to matter i mean it could be working on cars could be your hobby really,2,0

sw2424B-ms98-a,72,B,357.806625,360.790875,2.98425,there should be some sort of a control on it,1,0
sw2424B-ms98-a,73,B,360.790875,363.363125,2.57225,and they should be a little more humane,1,0

sw2426B-ms98-a,8,B,31.330125,34.891,3.560875,voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire i guess,1,0
sw2426B-ms98-a,85,B,406.037875,413.5155,7.477625,uh all that much over we've got to go back in there and and be sure that this large population isn't just wiped out,1,0
sw2426B-ms98-a,86,B,413.5155,417.199,3.6835,which is seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment,1,0
sw2426B-ms98-a,89,B,422.820625,433.363125,10.5425,oh well no no there there never will be i mean uh uh the only way that you're going to have peace over there if if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them,1,0
sw2426B-ms98-a,90,B,433.363125,438.96525,5.602125,you know until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but i don't think we want to make that decision either,1,0
sw2427A-ms98-a,128,A,387.65825,389.792625,2.134375,uh-huh it'd be handy ,1,0
sw2427A-ms98-a,133,A,397.925,399.356125,1.431125,it might be handy,1,0
sw2427A-ms98-a,143,A,415.55925,424.804375,9.245125,yeah that would be neat sure would we've had a garden gosh for years and years and years of some size you know i can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind,1,0
sw2427A-ms98-a,185,A,566.584,569.31775,2.73375,uh-huh that will be neat yeah,1,0
sw2427A-ms98-a,191,A,576.349875,577.74825,1.398375,yeah that will be neat yeah ,1,0
sw2427A-ms98-a,196,A,589.749375,593.659625,3.91025,yeah that'd be interesting yeah ,1,0
sw2427B-ms98-a,42,B,196.5365,200.303,3.7665,right right but it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself,1,0
sw2427B-ms98-a,73,B,362.68075,368.119875,5.439125,right then you know and you know if i i didn't wanna wait five years for it to be good enough to  you know ,1,0
sw2427B-ms98-a,82,B,416.381625,418.166,1.784375,that would be nice,1,0
sw2428A-ms98-a,13,A,71.546125,83.930625,12.3845,i'll be darn when i uh i'm in uh Plano right now but when i was up at uh McKinney i had uh IBM PS two i loved that thing i loved it,1,0
sw2428A-ms98-a,26,A,136.3815,147.38,10.9985,say  this is going to be a present for my grandchildren tell them all okay here you are and then i can sort it all that they can trace it back to their parents and the grandparents and on you know do an explosion,1,0
sw2428A-ms98-a,42,A,212.956,214.857375,1.901375,well i'll be darn,1,0
sw2428A-ms98-a,72,A,380.24675,387.564,7.31725,well you know you'd be surprised how many of the various ones are coming in and giving us demos at all times and i sit in on all this stuff,1,0
sw2428B-ms98-a,29,B,98.4155,102.56825,4.15275,well my wife and i are gonna be glad to get ours out of the house too i know exactly how you feel,1,0
sw2428B-ms98-a,64,B,290.52675,300.302,9.77525,so when the PC came on the market and then it was the first one on the market earlier than the Amiga was but when it came on the market people just naturally assumed that well if IBM makes it it should be the computer of my choice,1,0
sw2428B-ms98-a,66,B,306.412375,321.2785,14.866125,where but honestly an Amiga is far and away a much better PC than the PC will ever be it has a full multitasking operating system during the Christmas holidays while my kids played games with my machines i backed up my hard disk because i used my Commodore sixty four as a terminal to it like a main frame,1,0
sw2428B-ms98-a,79,B,386.9545,392.24725,5.29275,not only that but this machine can be hooked up to a regular TV set and you can do video presentations with it,1,0
sw2428B-ms98-a,87,B,436.816875,445.407625,8.59075,to the video tape because all the sound and graphics that it produces can be put right out of the back of the machine to a common VCR and recorded on a VHS tape,1,0
sw2428B-ms98-a,96,B,511.630125,519.87875,8.248625,and uh then you would uh with some add on options and things you'd have to have probably the outside price at the max would be about thirty five thirty six hundred dollars,1,0
sw2428B-ms98-a,100,B,548.601125,562.351625,13.7505,and peripheral handling chips inside and that's why it can be a multitask operating system and not and handle num- multiple jobs at once because it has three co-processor chips in there that help out the main CPU and off load it from doing the graphics,1,0
sw2429A-ms98-a,10,A,36.09575,45.90725,9.8115,well um i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or informal dinner party but if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish,1,0
sw2429A-ms98-a,42,A,273.44725,276.796125,3.348875,that would be fun,1,0
sw2429A-ms98-a,46,A,296.401875,303.97725,7.575375,sometimes it might be the candlelight and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something  well that's you know that's fun,2,0
sw2429A-ms98-a,63,A,396.45,401.308625,4.858625,i don't know i would i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around,1,0
sw2429A-ms98-a,69,A,418.60925,422.124,3.51475,oh that would be wonderful,1,0
sw2429A-ms98-a,85,A,499.64,514.2535,14.6135, hum that sounds great especially i mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance i mean like if if you are having a dinner party on Wednesday night you could do it on a weekend that would be great,1,0
sw2429A-ms98-a,87,A,526.623625,538.459625,11.836,i'm sure that i'll be involved in a big company and i know that my future husband will be you know he's going to be working for Chevron in Houston so he's going to be um,4,0
sw2429A-ms98-a,90,A,546.06275,559.668375,13.605625,oh yeah i have to impress the boss  and clients because_1 um i'm in i'm in public relations in school so i'm going to have you know my whole job's going to be based on my clients an- stuff like that so,1,0
sw2429B-ms98-a,53,B,256.0645,265.124875,9.060375,cook and then the next time it would be my turn and i'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me and  we we was really a lot of fun and,1,0
sw2429B-ms98-a,55,B,267.380375,270.24125,2.860875,yeah it did and we we tried to be,1,0
sw2429B-ms98-a,56,B,270.24125,283.3715,13.13025,fancier or more courses than the other or uh it was a lot of fun you know it something unique you know and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be,1,0
sw2429B-ms98-a,57,B,283.3715,297.478125,14.106625,ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh uh elegant theme or you know  it was a lot of fun,1,0
sw2429B-ms98-a,62,B,308.782375,319.521875,10.7395,make us dinner one time uh just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying i'm,1,0
sw2429B-ms98-a,75,B,359.960875,368.72525,8.764375,it can it can be fun i if you have the time but you know a lot of times it's too it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it,2,0
sw2429B-ms98-a,118,B,593.998625,596.449625,2.451,oh i will i'm sure my husband will be,1,0
sw2430B-ms98-a,21,B,102.259125,111.757,9.497875,not so much for the noise but if it were to jump a tooth or something of that nature i would be in serious problems on the freeway and i didn't want to chance Irene driving the car like that so,1,0
sw2430B-ms98-a,27,B,132.535875,139.977375,7.4415,well i figured if i had it done in the garage at the Toyota dealer i would be looking at probably three or four hundred dollars,1,0
sw2430B-ms98-a,55,B,273.0535,276.81275,3.75925,i imagine that would be a bear to work on you know uh,1,0
sw2430B-ms98-a,80,B,430.773,439.715125,8.942125,and they gladly take it but they only take it like for two hours on a Saturday morning you know and it's it gets to be a pain sometime to go through that but i think it's still worth it in the long run,1,0
sw2430B-ms98-a,87,B,489.284875,503.555875,14.271,if i had to do automotive repair or or anything i love to do woodwork and too and it's a diversion because i know i'd really don't have to do   so i think i like that because i know i don't have to do this but if if i were forced to do it that may be a different situation ,1,0
sw2431A-ms98-a,14,A,24.21325,34.625,10.41175,well it won't be too much longer because my husband and i are both going to re- retire and when we retire we're going to buy us a you know a new one and and get rid of the two that we have right now,1,0
sw2431A-ms98-a,40,A,151.132375,163.673875,12.5415,i always think well you know these things must be safe but that's just like i don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist,1,0
sw2431A-ms98-a,93,A,480.5365,482.42375,1.88725,oh that would be good,1,0
sw2431A-ms98-a,97,A,514.135375,522.61,8.474625,here that have been killed in head on collisions where maybe if they had they had that that air bag they may still be walking around,1,0
sw2431A-ms98-a,102,A,559.753375,568.2825,8.529125,where okay these cars i guess they figure all the old cars will be off the roads or something by the in ten years,1,0
sw2431B-ms98-a,43,B,212.8735,223.19775,10.32425,i have an Arrow Star van we really do uh it's it's a mini van we've had it goodness in May will be five years and uh they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty,1,0
sw2431B-ms98-a,81,B,375.154125,388.334,13.179875,well the mini the you'd be surprised if if you drive a one of the the mini vans uh fact there all more or less alike the the uh Chevrolet and uh well of course Oldsmobile has got one and Chryslers got one but they drive remarkably like cars,1,0
sw2431B-ms98-a,88,B,409.197625,420.821625,11.624,well you you can you can uh install those mirrors we've got the big side mirrors which are really nice i don't know if you've well if you've driven a pick up truck you know these are these uh mirrors are must be six inches across not nearly a foot high ,1,0
sw2431B-ms98-a,116,B,530.76725,533.699125,2.931875,it would be interesting to see what that'd do to our insurance rates,1,0
sw2431B-ms98-a,118,B,543.167625,547.4915,4.323875,would be interesting wouldn't it uh that wouldn't be fair but uh,2,0
sw2432A-ms98-a,21,A,61.28975,62.56275,1.273,that'd be good,1,0
sw2432A-ms98-a,60,A,180.100625,182.159,2.058375,oh that'd be good,1,0
sw2432A-ms98-a,141,A,474.111125,476.15225,2.041125,what do you think the outcome will be,1,0
sw2432B-ms98-a,94,B,360.964,363.62,2.656,it sounds like it you'd think you would be,1,0
sw2432B-ms98-a,106,B,421.145875,424.504,3.358125,well what are you going to be when you get out of college,1,0
sw2432B-ms98-a,111,B,442.486375,456.133875,13.6475,right and they had until the fifteenth of April to come up some formula that would be more equitable to dis- different districts according to finances because_1 the poor districts were getting less money so,1,0
sw2432B-ms98-a,118,B,481.613875,486.196375,4.5825, we're not looking forward to it but something's got to be done,1,0
sw2432B-ms98-a,138,B,533.75525,540.72,6.96475,probably a lot more civilized more um refined than a lot of the people would be down here,1,0
sw2432B-ms98-a,149,B,565.640375,568.43825,2.797875,she'd be big i don't know  what are you saying Holly ,1,0
sw2433A-ms98-a,38,A,176.26525,184.169375,7.904125,and you know this is one of those things like this orthopedist said he said you'd be surprised how many basket- how many people come in here with things like that because they are active,1,0
sw2433A-ms98-a,54,A,233.4165,236.7585,3.342,oh so the aerobics the impact would not be good,1,0
sw2433A-ms98-a,64,A,264.9055,271.071375,6.165875,that's probably the safer way because i notice in aerobics um lot of the women that that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things,1,0
sw2433B-ms98-a,100,B,342.27,350.4365,8.1665,uh-huh i mean it's real funny because if you you know it just seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you'd be tired but it's the other way around,1,0
sw2433B-ms98-a,140,B,498.799125,500.389375,1.59025,it's going to be real tender when they,1,0
sw2434A-ms98-a,71,A,358.8405,369.19525,10.35475,huh how do you feel about that do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the um buyer and the seller and or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system uh because you own it,2,0
sw2434B-ms98-a,11,B,90.499,104.35225,13.85325, i've never heard of anything like that that would be nice but a- you know the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other,1,0
sw2434B-ms98-a,47,B,351.083625,354.45275,3.369125,naw th- i guess that would be a good idea ,1,0
sw2434B-ms98-a,50,B,368.866625,377.406625,8.54,uh that's a hard one because_1 we did that but uh i think there ought to be some rule against it i'll uh,1,0
sw2434B-ms98-a,80,B,553.579625,558.942375,5.36275,yeah you know and i'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun ,1,0
sw2435A-ms98-a,8,A,31.94275,41.6595,9.71675,i wa- i was a lot more  uh impressed with her than i thought i would be it turned out to be a better thriller than i was expecting it to be so yeah it was a pretty good movie,3,0
sw2435A-ms98-a,20,A,84.085,96.759,12.674,is that any good i mean i'm sure i'm going to be seeing it because i'm going in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives and she's got two boys that i took to see the first one so i'm sure i'm going to see the next one here real soon,1,0
sw2435A-ms98-a,22,A,100.211125,107.40025,7.189125,oh well then it won't be too bad i mean i was you know it wasn't impressive necessarily but it was better than it could have been,1,0
sw2435A-ms98-a,40,A,215.836625,225.29725,9.460625,you know what i mean there there were times when he was like you know he'd be running with a gun or whatever he didn't look like a cop when he did it and i was so impressed with that because,1,0
sw2435A-ms98-a,48,A,289.32325,302.8675,13.54425,uh the the second time i saw it i didn't really enjoy it as much and i was kind of surprised at that i thought that would be one of those that i would love to watch over and over again but before i- maybe it's just the idea of my reaction the first time i laughed so hard i was hoarse,1,0
sw2435A-ms98-a,72,A,422.255625,431.731875,9.47625,of like when the buffaloes are when they're chasing the buffaloes and everything you've got to be where you feel it you really truly do i would i mean,1,0
sw2435B-ms98-a,152,B,540.459625,551.095125,10.6355,oh that'll be good yeah we we really need some my husband keeps wanting to yeah and i heard the video's even going to be longer they're gonna put in a lot of stuff that they cut out,2,0
sw2436A-ms98-a,32,A,181.146625,190.59475,9.448125,that's that's uh that's going to be good and interesting for the kids even even cartoons um y- you know you  you watch uh you watch some of the cartoons and,1,0
sw2436A-ms98-a,60,A,322.67425,337.5425,14.86825,well it's kind of it's kind of like reading magazines any more if if half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials it probably wouldn't be so bad but uh it it's you're missing an awful lot i'd rather personally rather watch ,1,0

sw2446B-ms98-a,28,B,223.623875,236.35075,12.726875,the time that i was down there i stayed quite a a bit at the uh uh one of the big hotels San Salvador and at the time i thought there ought to be a law against American tourists,1,0
sw2446B-ms98-a,29,B,236.35075,241.61425,5.2635,because they for the most part tend to be the most obnoxious,1,0
sw2446B-ms98-a,40,B,298.28,308.569875,10.289875,situation and i saw incidences in the hotel where i just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say oh my God those are those are not Americans  they can't be but they are,1,0
sw2447A-ms98-a,40,A,199.28975,213.999125,14.709375,because they both work and they uh he's a fireman so he's home two days a week that she teaches and would not be there so i don't know how she manages it but she keeps that a secret and i would not want to pay her monthly,1,0
sw2447A-ms98-a,41,A,213.999125,219.27675,5.277625,interest rate on the thing it just has to be awful because it,1,0
sw2447A-ms98-a,116,A,562.49625,568.994875,6.498625,i guess so  that would be wonderful wouldn't it ,1,0
sw2447B-ms98-a,40,B,233.80625,240.692625,6.886375,be well i- i think i would feel the same way i'd i'd really feel like i'd been deceived you know that that wasn't the thing to do,1,0
sw2448A-ms98-a,5,A,10.989,14.1045,3.1155,well this should be very interesting because_1 i'm against it,1,0
sw2448A-ms98-a,9,A,37.22925,47.4665,10.23725, and yet their uh the gun control enthusiasts are are uh preaching about the gun control and how they should be ha- we should have stronger laws and what not,1,0
sw2448A-ms98-a,55,A,277.828625,282.0485,4.219875,so anyway well we seem to be one in favor and one against,1,0
sw2448A-ms98-a,59,A,295.33625,302.286375,6.950125,well there should be some way of checking now here in in Texas uh all you need is a driver's license,1,0
sw2448B-ms98-a,7,B,13.465875,20.166,6.700125,i don't i don't mind people owning guns i just think it should be a little you know a little a little more regulated,1,0
sw2448B-ms98-a,38,B,120.092125,131.978,11.885875,um-hum that's true i i like i say i don't have any problem with people using firearms you know for sporting purposes or hunting purposes i just think it's just may be a little too easy you know to acquire one,1,0
sw2448B-ms98-a,64,B,222.677,225.754,3.077,i wouldn't think it'd be that difficult to do,1,0
sw2448B-ms98-a,87,B,288.448875,295.047375,6.5985,uh yeah i'm not totally rigid on the subject i just think there should be you know shouldn't be quite so easy to do,2,0
sw2448B-ms98-a,115,B,360.519375,362.601,2.081625,that'd be neat sure would,1,0

sw2451A-ms98-a,8,A,73.033,88.002375,14.969375,is the result of that i- if they can get the army or the military to sway to their side i think that uh it will be on the way out eventually,1,0
sw2451A-ms98-a,43,A,372.925875,376.04925,3.123375,it seems to be headed in that direction too,1,0
sw2451A-ms98-a,74,A,568.024375,574.7155,6.691125,concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be,1,0
sw2451B-ms98-a,9,B,151.589875,165.0625,13.472625,that there'll be some you know politically speaking you know he's going to have more power and i think it's a step in the right direction i think Gorbachev realizes that he's got a a major uh,1,0
sw2451B-ms98-a,10,B,165.0625,176.821,11.7585,uh power figure you know competing against him and i think it's gonna be pretty close to his demise if he doesn't follow suit with Yeltsin as far as uh realizing,1,0
sw2452A-ms98-a,11,A,56.168,65.64575,9.47775,the other thing that i think is good for like American businesses are to be involved is the the reports that i hear back and of course on the news i i try to,1,0
sw2452A-ms98-a,14,A,73.52475,87.208625,13.683875,you know took such a proactive stance i- involvement in the war that like so much of the buil- business and rebuilding Kuwait and things like that will go to American businesses where as before they may be dealt with Japanese firms or other people they said even though the Japanese,1,0
sw2452A-ms98-a,15,A,87.208625,97.2535,10.044875,were involved monetarily uh they fill like the first first priority ought to go to American businesses which i guess will be good you know which will be good for our economy,2,0
sw2452A-ms98-a,41,A,215.235125,222.289125,7.054,yeah supply arms support them_1 if they need help but i don't think we ought to be over there fighting it for them_1 and and so i think he's done good on that stance,1,0
sw2452A-ms98-a,98,A,509.579625,518.154375,8.57475,kind of tried to straddle the fence you know he he wasn't necessarily for Iraq at the same time he didn't feel like everybody else ought to be going against Iraq,1,0
sw2452B-ms98-a,76,B,314.269375,318.890625,4.62125,and uh and i don't think he's going to be there too much longer,1,0
sw2452B-ms98-a,89,B,365.734625,377.236375,11.50175,um this League of Nations uh w- will always combine against bullies and and to stop this kind of stuff in the world any any would be bully would think twice if he knew that,1,0

sw2452B-ms98-a,110,B,465.855625,478.69475,12.839125,yeah the it's going to be really tough for them to swallow but but we don't want a Kuwait there that's also you know just has no power at all and and and that you know because_1 Iran still isn't too friendly with them_1,1,0
sw2452B-ms98-a,111,B,478.69475,485.70225,7.0075,a- and we don't want you know it'd be be stabilized to the point where Iran will say now is our chance you know go in and wipe them out and,2,0
sw2453A-ms98-a,16,A,69.3045,77.24925,7.94475,i think the biggest problem uh the biggest change that needs to be made is the way that women are paid,1,0
sw2453A-ms98-a,23,A,111.538,125.3185,13.7805,but you know i'm a single parent trying to raise a child and it really upsets me not to be paid you know the same for my job now i don't see that so much in my job but i know in other professions,1,0

sw2453A-ms98-a,59,A,314.44525,329.254875,14.809625,well i think that that there's more you know there is definitely more women in public office uh i think it's going to be a long time before we see a woman president uh i don't think that's going to happen in the next ten years i don't,1,0
sw2453A-ms98-a,93,A,503.729,518.2895,14.5605,we might see a woman vice president that wouldn't surprise me and then of course if something happened to be uh  if something happened she would be president but it would not be something that she were elected to,3,0
sw2453B-ms98-a,8,B,56.59525,69.507,12.91175,but i think that uh the changes in the next twenty years will probably be just as drastic you you'll see more women CEOs and more more women holding public offices,1,0
sw2453B-ms98-a,29,B,238.246625,251.535,13.288375,the household chores and duties and what has to be done so i think over a couple of generations time it will all change because it's really been uh my generation i'm twenty five and and my generation,1,0
sw2453B-ms98-a,31,B,261.188,269.968625,8.780625,so it will be my children who really make big changes i think because that they will probably the majority of children,1,0
sw2453B-ms98-a,45,B,351.9865,361.155125,9.168625,i don't know any statistics either but it's it's probably going to be the same type of situation that that uh the black people have gone through it took them,1,0
sw2453B-ms98-a,46,B,361.155125,371.9865,10.831375, well black men  a long time to to get up to the pay scales of the white man and now i think it it's feasible for a black man to be president,1,0
sw2453B-ms98-a,86,B,532.379125,543.33325,10.954125,the world several major countries in the world that we deal with all the time don't respect women as business people so a woman president would be,1,0
sw2453B-ms98-a,93,B,581.143625,595.647375,14.50375,and and the men basically see a business woman and ask them to go get coffee or something it's just it's very difficult to be well respected and and Margaret Margaret Thatcher had been in office it was probably very difficult for her at first but,1,0
sw2454A-ms98-a,12,A,54.483125,58.016625,3.5335,uh it has to be government regulation,1,0

sw2454A-ms98-a,49,A,253.978375,268.46875,14.490375,and the other thing is they said the insur- the uh insurance agents the insurance industry is beginning to resemble the savings and loan industry so they they say the next big crisis could well be our insurance,1,0
sw2454A-ms98-a,96,A,545.47975,555.670375,10.190625,that lowers their threshold of income of what they have to pay taxes on which automat- automatically makes our taxes go up because there is so much that has to be paid,1,0
sw2454B-ms98-a,27,B,81.98875,85.70425,3.7155,he can be out in twenty months they said,1,0
sw2454B-ms98-a,44,B,184.998375,199.505375,14.507,well they need to prosecute the people who are taking the millions and millions a lot a lot better than they are have been Dickson is the only one i even heard of i mean there may be more that they are prosecuting but Dickson is the only one i even heard of,1,0
sw2454B-ms98-a,49,B,217.27975,223.44425,6.1645,there are bigger fish i know i mean otherwise it wouldn't be in such a mess,1,0
sw2455A-ms98-a,6,A,33.614625,46.98675,13.372125,job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or you know all sorts of other things,1,0
sw2455A-ms98-a,52,A,332.7065,346.123125,13.416625,i don't yeah i well i see i think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children uh and even those who may not do it seem to be,1,0
sw2455A-ms98-a,56,A,371.82975,378.931125,7.101375,but it would be nice if there could be an in-between a middle ground somewhere,2,0
sw2455A-ms98-a,63,A,433.414,435.3005,1.8865,being what it ought to be,1,0
sw2455B-ms98-a,24,B,97.46125,109.8155,12.35425,yeah i uh i think that while it's a good change for i think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel you know their,1,0
sw2455B-ms98-a,25,B,109.8155,118.06175,8.24625,expertise may be uh i think sometimes other things suffer and that i think it's hard to find a balance there,1,0
sw2455B-ms98-a,30,B,138.341375,149.344875,11.0035,when i- i i happen to you know be i'm very active with uh people other people with children my age and most of us do tend to stay home but,1,0

sw2455B-ms98-a,53,B,282.038375,290.965875,8.9275,well i- i i hope that they will change uh but but i'm i just i know it's going to be a slow change uh i,1,0
sw2455B-ms98-a,74,B,403.758625,408.526875,4.76825,they uh they they want to know things are going to be a certain way,1,0

sw2456A-ms98-a,85,A,348.448,360.4995,12.0515,they keep they keep coming with this well when we die they're yours i don't i don't want to wait until your dead i  you'll probably have it in your will that you're going to be buried with them_1 i don't know,1,0
sw2456A-ms98-a,115,A,499.356125,507.25225,7.896125,no they've been fighting for thousands of years and it will be they'll fight for thousands of more years it it it's going to go on forever,1,0

sw2457A-ms98-a,25,A,138.6565,149.73525,11.07875,in uh July and everyone kept saying oh you're going up north it's not going to be so hot it's not going to be so humid and yeah that has just not been the case it has been,2,0
sw2457A-ms98-a,92,A,418.76725,426.4525,7.68525,no i have seen those i have driven around in the neighborhoods and seen those little flood gauges that will be there little yellow signs,1,0
sw2457A-ms98-a,95,A,437.30225,439.662,2.35975,yeah that would be awful,1,0
sw2457B-ms98-a,52,B,264.551875,268.157375,3.6055,yeah that would be gosh,1,0
sw2457B-ms98-a,69,B,336.04,345.175875,9.135875,i can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that i just don't even want to go out you know the    the mail   leave me in the air conditioning,1,0
sw2458A-ms98-a,1,A,0,4.678375,4.678375,hell air pollution tends to be a a topic that uh,1,0
sw2458A-ms98-a,2,A,4.678375,16.023625,11.34525,some people have a lot to say on and some don't care much for it at all but uh i found that there's there seems to be quite a bit that the individual can do as far as air pollution and one thing,1,0
sw2458A-ms98-a,6,A,45.625625,56.210375,10.58475,proper day as far as the temperature goes you can have a cloud of smoke hovering other a neighborhood that's just sickening really i mean it may be pleasant inside but it stinks outside,1,0
sw2458A-ms98-a,37,A,263.005125,273.851,10.845875, it may not be us yeah we have a um they happen to use about the same abbreviation for the Dallas area they use Dallas Area Rapid Transit for DART and uh,1,0
sw2458B-ms98-a,23,B,238.2075,252.640375,14.432875,and that line being of of uh you know a a a a planet that's going to be able to continue to live or it's gradually already dying and it will not be renewable i mean we may have crossed that line,2,0
sw2458B-ms98-a,24,B,252.640375,258.137,5.496625,and it will be up to our kids and maybe their kids to you know,1,0
sw2458B-ms98-a,26,B,259.826125,264.47875,4.652625,and things will live on this planet but humans may not be able to anymore,1,0
sw2458B-ms98-a,55,B,481.47775,486.802625,5.324875,if if it were to be jettisoned lower you know before it got up that high,1,0
sw2459A-ms98-a,3,A,3.924625,18.0965,14.171875,well uh i'm i'm for it to be honest with you i think uh that um uh honestly if you feel you have something to hide that would tend to make you be against it but if you don't really have anything to hide even though i know it is sorted of an invasion in one's privacy,2,0
sw2459A-ms98-a,5,A,29.23575,37.72625,8.4905,catch those who might not be and and k- and the kinds of problems that they can cause in the work environment or even outside the work environment i hate to think about,1,0
sw2459A-ms98-a,8,A,50.454625,63.347875,12.89325,oh yeah well that that's right i i i i haven't quite thought of that uh uh that's a very good point now limitations i i d- i do think there needs to be some sort of limitations to the way you test because my wife who is a nurse,1,0
sw2459A-ms98-a,10,A,74.964125,89.8495,14.885375,so it seems to me that uh even though i i personally think it's a good idea that there does need to be some some uh thought given to it some serious thought about how you can do it how you can exempt people at least the s- periods of time short or long periods of time uh,1,0
sw2459A-ms98-a,28,A,153.834125,165.16425,11.330125,and so it seems to me the idea of having random and i agree with the idea of random because that way nobody ever knows for sure when it might be their time i i uh agree that uh random checks uh,1,0
sw2459A-ms98-a,29,A,165.16425,172.320125,7.155875,of uh people be it in schooling systems or on the job uh i think the text the uh the topic was suppose to be on the job,2,0
sw2459A-ms98-a,91,A,427.019,438.767125,11.748125,and uh it's not the sort of issue the people go and petition the legislatures to do uh uh unfortunately it seems to be the sort of thing that somehow or another legislatures do to pressure from the private sector who maybe having trouble,1,0
sw2459A-ms98-a,103,A,510.0865,520.230125,10.143625,but but it should be given in a positive light so that you can try to help them and at the same time you can find out where they're getting the substances from it puts pressure on those who would try to push things illegal like that,1,0
sw2459A-ms98-a,104,A,520.230125,531.95775,11.727625,because they know the people that they're pushing it to if they're in a work place where they can be randomly checked when it happens then they stand a chance of being turned in and you got ways now of cutting the whole drug traffic trade,1,0
sw2459B-ms98-a,9,B,100.90175,111.38475,10.483,well i personally think that uh it should be done also uh my feelings are the same as yours from that standpoint i spent thirty four years in education,1,0
sw2459B-ms98-a,10,B,111.38475,119.918625,8.533875,as a teacher and administrator right and uh so i saw drugs from uh the early very early fifties uh be-,1,0
sw2459B-ms98-a,27,B,208.846125,216.926125,8.08,uh striving for could definitely be an error or misconstrued or misread or any number of things which could mean peoples lives,1,0
sw2459B-ms98-a,40,B,271.096625,280.431625,9.335,doing nothing but resolving problems with schools that were assigned to me that couldn't be resolved on a local level which could be a complaint on a principal or a teacher or,2,0
sw2459B-ms98-a,52,B,380.528,391.405375,10.877375,i think so uh i i see nothing wrong with that i think that that it should be uh better accepted than um uh forced testing of everyone,1,0
sw2459B-ms98-a,80,B,590.048875,598.806,8.757125,and uh but you implant the idea that this is not wh- not what they need to be doing for themselves and here's how to a-,1,0
sw2460A-ms98-a,14,A,68.419125,72.450125,4.031,well i didn't know that that's supposed to be a real good statistic uh,1,0
sw2460A-ms98-a,37,A,232.559625,247.005,14.445375,having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you you know gives you one run obviously but i mean if you can't do it with men on base there's something definitely wrong um you know you you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs you know to to be able to,2,0
sw2460A-ms98-a,38,A,247.005,252.438125,5.433125,uh score enough runs to be able win in these uh in this day and age so,1,0
sw2460A-ms98-a,57,A,342.626625,347.690625,5.064,that well it can be it it really kind of depends on on um,1,0
sw2460A-ms98-a,59,A,355.744375,368.063875,12.3195,um then it really doesn't give you any indication but if they were uh playing the people that they're going to play then that might be pretty good indication so you know it's it's it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just,1,0
sw2460A-ms98-a,68,A,419.0265,422.030875,3.004375,you know and and so they may be even be- better this year,2,0
sw2460A-ms98-a,71,A,428.513,440.96025,12.44725,and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question they're doing the right thing though uh they are going with their farm system they're letting their farm system uh build up and stuff like that and,1,0
sw2460A-ms98-a,84,A,515.31,528.213125,12.903125,uh you got me i you know i think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can't go and once you do that you lose everything i mean,1,0
sw2460B-ms98-a,50,B,386.139375,393.716,7.576625,and and the question is how do you forecast that if you had to you know if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series i mean it'd be really tough,2,0
sw2461A-ms98-a,1,A,0,9.056875,9.056875, okay we're gonna talk about the public school system what's wrong with it and or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it,1,0
sw2461A-ms98-a,5,A,20.082625,27.131875,7.04925,yeah it's amazing um  i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough i mean to be doing what they're doing,1,0
sw2461A-ms98-a,16,A,97.95875,109.62625,11.6675,yeah he's gonna be going to kindergarten so so you know we're we're thinking about that wha- th- wh- that gonna be like are they gonna be taught nothing are they gonna be taught something we're gonna we're gonna be involved in our child's education we're gonna be teaching him what we can at home of course,6,0
sw2461A-ms98-a,28,A,177.528125,185.161,7.632875,yeah we talked you talked about before about the the school funding i think there's only gonna be one solution to school funding which i- i don't think will be necessarily,2,0
sw2461A-ms98-a,29,A,185.161,196.96,11.799,the best way but i think wh- what's gonna have to happen is there's gonna have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids that's the only way they're gonna fund it because_1 they start raising taxes for property and people are gonna throw a fit,1,0
sw2461A-ms98-a,33,A,204.021375,208.143875,4.1225,yeah and the only thing they they wou- would think of would be tuition,1,0
sw2461A-ms98-a,35,A,216.5275,221.530125,5.002625,but it'll be hard for those that people ha- ha- have in school because_1 they have to pay out even more,1,0
sw2461A-ms98-a,44,A,255.164125,263.879625,8.7155,i mean i wou- i'd be afraid to be in school i mean b- teaching or even a being a student and think what's what's it gonna be like for my my youngest and my oldest son when he goes to school,3,0
sw2461A-ms98-a,48,A,290.301125,296.174375,5.87325,so you know it's a lot different now and what's it gonna be like in another twelve years when my uh oldest son's in high school,1,0
sw2461A-ms98-a,53,A,311.877375,324.69725,12.819875,that's all you can do you got to you got to be your child's best friend i guess even when they're a teenager and they you know are kind of standoffish still you got to be their best friend because_1 when they got problems who they gonna go to their friends that are dealing drugs or or there parents,2,0
sw2461A-ms98-a,54,A,324.69725,328.711375,4.014125,you know and and if they go to their friends dealing drugs they're gonna be in even worse shape,1,0
sw2461A-ms98-a,64,A,371.465625,375.251375,3.78575,that's right well i got to be going so uh,1,0
sw2461B-ms98-a,37,B,159.5405,170.4665,10.926,right you know  that's one reason we bought a house here in Plano we were hoping you know well the school district's gonna be good you know for resale value and so on and so forth but,1,0
sw2461B-ms98-a,38,B,170.4665,178.23225,7.76575,um i can definitely uh see on down the road you know when we do have kids and are getting to that age that's gonna be a definite concern,1,0
sw2461B-ms98-a,54,B,268.386125,282.872625,14.4865,well no and you and you wanna encourage them_1 you know to to be active and everything in school but uh you know with all the peer pressure that's going on with all the negative things it is uh it's a tough environment to be growing up in,2,0
sw2461B-ms98-a,61,B,300.76375,315.2345,14.47075,but uh  i don't know i i guess what you have to do is just uh keep en- uh you know encouraging them_1 and and uh uh try to be open with them so that you can deal with the problems as they come up yeah and,1,0
sw2463A-ms98-a,9,A,44.41275,47.697875,3.285125,try to find a time when everybody can be there and we've,1,0

sw2463B-ms98-a,98,B,572.52425,583.354375,10.830125,by arranging for different family reunions and class reunions all over the country yeah i always thought that would be kind of might be kind of fun you know especially with a class reunion where you have to ,2,0
sw2464A-ms98-a,7,A,20.684,30.702375,10.018375,actually i didn't either um uh i really wasn't familiar with that and um i didn't even realize i had put that as you know this must be something,1,0
sw2464A-ms98-a,8,A,30.702375,38.453625,7.75125,fairly new because i don't remember this as even being one of the topics you know  had to put have be discussed,1,0
sw2464A-ms98-a,32,A,133.246375,137.051375,3.805,uh if this would be a voluntary thing or a mandatory,1,0
sw2464A-ms98-a,36,A,146.614375,158.151,11.536625,well i think i would also and i think it it really uh would be very difficult in terms of uh you know people i'm thinking mainly people going to college i don't see how,1,0
sw2464A-ms98-a,50,A,221.816375,238.546,16.729625,to take you know whether you wanted to study American Indians or this or that maybe as one of those six week sessions instead of having a class um or have the class but as part of that or part of the credit would be to do something like that on a voluntary basis,1,0
sw2464A-ms98-a,71,A,351.09425,360.730125,9.635875,in with high school students and get them to be aware that you know they're not uh especially teenagers they're not the only ones around and what maybe their,1,0
sw2464A-ms98-a,91,A,450.145875,462.452875,12.307,exist    and and i think it might be another good public service might be to have them help out in geriatric homes or you know this type of thing they are around uh,2,0
sw2464A-ms98-a,99,A,492.26125,500.012375,7.751125,the kids when they're younger is better though i think once they're out of high school they're so into their own thing that i think it would be very difficult maybe by that,1,0
sw2464A-ms98-a,102,A,515.9165,527.065625,11.149125,and i think it's the younger it's the younger uh kids that it reaches more and so if they want to start this type of thing it should be integrated maybe from a young age and and,1,0
sw2464A-ms98-a,115,A,569.107875,577.567375,8.4595,yeah well this is a good area because you're far enough away and yet you're close you know so holidays and things or whatever you wanted to you can be there but,1,0
sw2464B-ms98-a,34,B,135.9995,147.30225,11.30275,yeah the way the the way the voice might have worded it it sounded almost mandatory as opposed to elected and i would obviously i mean not obviously but i would be against anything like that being mandatory,1,0
sw2464B-ms98-a,92,B,461.015625,474.811375,13.79575,yeah i think the one thing the the there's a program called uh Habitat For Humanity that Jimmy Carter started the former president and i think i think programs like that with what you just talked about going on in your area local area at and something like that would be good,1,0
sw2465A-ms98-a,105,A,442.8405,449.2495,6.409,well yeah but you know i need to be at the office too you know  i've just got to deal with all those other things that happen but,1,0
sw2465B-ms98-a,8,B,34.748375,43.04925,8.300875,it's basically just data entry and running you know some some software so it doesn't really have to be anything sophisticated you know,1,0
sw2465B-ms98-a,67,B,268.637875,275.0545,6.416625,yeah i guess it's not it's all you know it's inexpensive compared to what it used to be but it's a lot to put into one ,1,0
sw2465B-ms98-a,69,B,278.624875,293.32275,14.697875,that's  no it's not it  it's not pocket change so it's major so but maybe when the kids get in school that will be you know when they start needing something you know then that will be different but,2,0
sw2465B-ms98-a,124,B,471.109625,482.99125,11.881625,uh-huh that's  that's right that would be uh you know because it's real nice with this because i don't even have to go into the office i've maybe been into the office once in the past three years you know,1,0
sw2466B-ms98-a,39,B,157.605875,167.84025,10.234375,oh i would imagine helping them feel good about themselves they're at a bad stage anyway and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible as a teen,1,0
sw2466B-ms98-a,40,B,167.84025,176.16,8.31975,that's uh boy uh that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that,3,0
sw2466B-ms98-a,85,B,433.04275,446.269,13.22625,and so uh i got myself involved in a sales job and right now uh my list of books to be read have to do with uh the art of selling so,1,0
sw2466B-ms98-a,89,B,460.45075,469.421875,8.971125,there- never there's never going to be enough hours in the day even if you took speed reading huh yeah,1,0
sw2467A-ms98-a,24,A,165.478875,166.85,1.371125,wow must be nice,1,0
sw2467A-ms98-a,96,A,401.1845,409.1215,7.937,or or so it seems i- i may just be paranoid but that state income tax is just eating me alive,1,0
sw2467B-ms98-a,7,B,41.37425,49.873375,8.499125,uh you can pretty much uh figure what they're going to be and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you,1,0
sw2467B-ms98-a,17,B,112.281,118.521625,6.240625,yeah pretty much um the problem is there never seems to be enough money,1,0
sw2467B-ms98-a,100,B,451.4175,457.8405,6.423,yeah it sure does um there's uh some good books that i've read um that you might be interested in,1,0
sw2467B-ms98-a,109,B,494.68875,504.546375,9.857625, you know be wealthier uh he also has a new book out that i purchased right before i moved and haven't had a chance to uh to crack it open yet um ,1,0
sw2467B-ms98-a,111,B,508.67175,521.49375,12.822,uh the man uh has a lot of good ideas some of them i already knew about some of them i had already practiced but uh i suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because uh ,1,0
sw2468A-ms98-a,44,A,247.495375,257.412125,9.91675,right i'm going to inject a little side anecdote for you back to the to the uh uh the main topic here because it it you might be interested in this uh you know i've i've,1,0
sw2468A-ms98-a,56,A,357.695375,367.2915,9.596125,and Margaret Thatcher was embarrassed that Janet would think that she was going to ask her            and her husband kept looking at her and said i can't believe you could be so dumb ,1,0
sw2468A-ms98-a,58,A,376.10925,389.7005,13.59125,that there seems to be a higher percent of the expatriate population i mean well over fifty percent that do bother to to register with the embassy and go vote you'd almost think that you think you're more important when you're out of the country and you're exposed to some things,1,0
sw2468B-ms98-a,29,B,187.15175,196.73475,9.583,to those of us in the military the cuts and things like that and and i would be like well are you registered to vote have you you know made any uh,1,0
sw2468B-ms98-a,30,B,196.73475,206.74125,10.0065, changes you know as far as your voting habits on you know who who you're voting for and what you're looking for and and uh no they'd say no and i'd be well then,1,0
sw2468B-ms98-a,35,B,227.339625,237.91775,10.578125,for for that state if  like in Texas we don't have it so yeah but but if you are you know they withdraw that from your pay and uh you can be you can,1,0
sw2468B-ms98-a,36,B,237.91775,248.78875,10.871,you can uh be uh have suits brought against you as if you were from that state yeah so you are attached to that state from which you came from ,1,0
sw2469A-ms98-a,32,A,147.242,161.7925,14.5505,no you must pay all attention to what you're doing it's it's it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be it took me uh quite a bit of time i thought oh this won't take long at all but i was wrong it took wh- it took a while to do but it was fun i enjoyed it,1,0
sw2469A-ms98-a,75,A,365.65525,377.30675,11.6515,i think when i was real little i probably had a finger in on that every time he did it and had to you know be out there and watch and that type of stuff but i've never really tried anything like that since then,1,0
sw2469A-ms98-a,103,A,470.691125,478.30725,7.616125,cats cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine but i just think dogs need need to be outside so,1,0
sw2469A-ms98-a,110,A,499.8785,505.79725,5.91875,with little ones i'd be kind of scared  to get anything that that has teeth or claws,1,0
sw2469B-ms98-a,13,B,45.467,55.712125,10.245125,fills up any time of space i get too involved in reading sometimes that i neglect what i should be doing so i  you get so involved in what you're reading,1,0
sw2469B-ms98-a,81,B,381.200375,389.315875,8.1155,i think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch we get lots of sunlight here and the porch is screened in and it's pretty large,1,0
sw2469B-ms98-a,83,B,390.992875,396.820375,5.8275,i think if i just would be if i'd do something be motivated enough to do something i think it would work out well,2,0
sw2469B-ms98-a,99,B,451.9465,460.89675,8.95025,but i like dogs and my husband like cats so we haven't reached a real agreement on that   if we get a place where we can have both it'll be great but until then ,1,0
sw2469B-ms98-a,104,B,477.02325,481.549125,4.525875,yeah i agree with you i if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat,1,0
sw2469B-ms98-a,114,B,514.255625,521.485625,7.23,and if i was a cat or dog i'd respond probably by  or something i don't  that would be my self-defense but,1,0
sw2470A-ms98-a,24,A,275.87275,286.50225,10.6295,i would be impacted a great deal on the things that i do in my life i'm i'm sure i would probably find ways to return to what i was doing in nineteen eighty one when i,1,0
sw2470A-ms98-a,25,A,286.50225,292.87125,6.369,got my first home computer but i- it would be i think a d- a dramatic sense of loss on on some items,1,0
sw2470A-ms98-a,30,A,328.45725,337.263,8.80575,frequently as a dumbhead to get to the mainframe and and there i tend on almost all of my editing and stuff to to be using some fairly powerful,1,0
sw2470A-ms98-a,48,A,525.53875,535.971625,10.432875,noticed how wonderful it might be uh i suspect Lotus One Two Three and spreadsheet application might be the one common thread,2,0
sw2470B-ms98-a,7,B,59.6285,68.45125,8.82275,would probably not be satisfied with anything less than a really nice one and that's that's a quite an expense and then all the software tends to be uh,2,0
sw2470B-ms98-a,11,B,93.823375,108.012625,14.18925,a number of things that i could could be doing on a PC instead of here instead of doing them at the h- at work they're for the house but i do them on occasion at work and it's nice to uh it would be nice to have one i guess what do you think,2,0
sw2470B-ms98-a,46,B,431.707375,444.006625,12.29925,uh or have a machine at home i would like to be able to put together small uh brochure type things with the the front page being a little little bit of graphics and the inside being printed in a ,1,0
sw2470B-ms98-a,49,B,466.798875,479.647375,12.8485,and she likes to work up little outlines and things in this format and so i do all the work for her at work and it would really be nice to be able to do it here and say is this what you want you know instead of going back and forth every day it takes us a little while to get it right,2,0
sw2471A-ms98-a,33,A,263.899375,274.477375,10.578,yes it's really kind of sad and that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and,1,0

sw2471B-ms98-a,15,B,114.378375,127.143125,12.76475,i- i agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world and so um there's a lot of money to be made there and it's uh be very difficult to to cut it back to a level where it should be,3,0
sw2471B-ms98-a,25,B,205.54875,210.4895,4.94075,through some uh method i don't know where where that'll be another big problem,1,0
sw2471B-ms98-a,35,B,251.685625,264.223875,12.53825,right yeah we're just so much wealthier and uh and uh there has to be resentment built up and that's where uh leaders can use uh use that whenever the opportune moment arises,1,0
sw2472A-ms98-a,62,A,223.023375,228.457125,5.43375,oh and pour that over it that sounds great it'd be pretty,1,0
sw2472A-ms98-a,66,A,235.132125,237.072,1.939875,right that would be pretty,1,0
sw2472B-ms98-a,43,B,162.04875,174.127875,12.079125,what time should we be  that sounds wonderful  i love desserts but since there's only two of us it's really i i try to avoid making anything,1,0
sw2472B-ms98-a,82,B,362.01975,365.42325,3.4035,definitely go with it it'll have to be a rice dish,1,0
sw2472B-ms98-a,94,B,405.603125,411.41725,5.814125,that's what i was just thinking it doesn't sound like it would it would be hard at all where did you get ,1,0
sw2472B-ms98-a,109,B,463.93775,471.813625,7.875875,and we do eat a lot of pasta so we we just said the other night it wouldn't be too difficult to be,2,0
sw2473A-ms98-a,115,A,477.904875,484.12725,6.222375,i am almost a junior  after this semester in May i'll be a junior,1,0

sw2473B-ms98-a,61,B,245.4485,255.3105,9.862,uh you you can pull them_1 in with some degree of regularity it seems as the summer comes when it gets warm and you have calm days without a lot of wind they seem to be uh far more prevalent,1,0
sw2473B-ms98-a,131,B,526.04775,529.567875,3.520125,okay so that would be two long semesters and a summer maybe huh,1,0
sw2473B-ms98-a,139,B,555.2135,567.996375,12.782875,and actually the academic part isn't bad when your when you resume because it seems that things come easier because you're more mature and you've got all your life experiences and i thought the academic part would be harder but it really isn't,1,0
sw2473B-ms98-a,140,B,567.996375,576.641,8.644625,uh be- uh it because uh uh i don't know i think the maturity factor uh uh overcomes the fact that you've had a gap,1,0
sw2474A-ms98-a,4,A,18.56625,29.352,10.78575,well we had some rain we've had a li- i live in Oak Cliff so we've had a little bit of rain but uh i don't know it seems to be warmer this year,1,0

sw2474B-ms98-a,14,B,77.701375,91.4885,13.787125,and everything but there is a difference uh when i used to drive a convertible all the time i'd have the top down and maybe it was sixty in Dallas and then i'd drive up into Plano and be like go- i'm cold you  turn the heat on   ,1,0
sw2474B-ms98-a,49,B,243.597875,251.172375,7.5745,and so they sent it to me and and i said oh yeah that'll be cool and one of them there's four that they send,1,0
sw2474B-ms98-a,50,B,251.172375,259.801625,8.62925,and i've got one that's going to be pink one that's going to be white no i take it back one is going to be yellow uh one that's going to be red and white,4,0
sw2474B-ms98-a,51,B,259.801625,273.588875,13.78725,and one that's going to be pink and white so i'm anxious to see what they look like because_1 that's all they tell you they just say well they're supposed to be these colors they don't tell you which ones supposed to be which so i've got these things planted out there that have numbers and i've,3,0
sw2474B-ms98-a,57,B,302.566625,315.196125,12.6295,oh it's going to be re- it's going to be really neat it really is and so i'm real excited about it because it's we have the bed for them we dug up the soil i mean we took the soil up and like two feet by two feet down,2,0
sw2474B-ms98-a,96,B,491.141875,504.355375,13.2135,well that's all i all i do is i water mine once a week and they're kind of like succulents so if you kind of forget to water them_1 a little bit sometime- they'll be okay but the problem i think most people have with African Violets is that they water too much,1,0
sw2476A-ms98-a,17,A,63.690625,76.375125,12.6845,really the seventies the early seventies was a period of the most change and if i had to be somewhat abstract about it it seems to be the major change has been that woman have acquired more choice,2,0
sw2476A-ms98-a,35,A,170.8275,185.523,14.6955,and i you know i say all power to her because she's an example to me of someone who really does have the choice i feel that a lot of uh women don't well i i said they have the choice but they don't necessarily feel that they do because they no longer  feel like if they were to just be a parent,1,0
sw2476A-ms98-a,36,A,185.523,196.979625,11.456625,rather than uh you know the sort of super woman success in the business world as well they would somehow be perceived as a failure in their own eyes or in others and and then you s- then it's not a choice anymore,1,0
sw2476A-ms98-a,40,A,216.40425,224.768875,8.364625,and i'm going to i'm going to be the primary caretaker and you know and then then take care of the children because_1 we don't want to put them in day care and this and that i think most,1,0
sw2476A-ms98-a,97,A,466.002125,471.928125,5.926,no it we don't get much Texas politics out in California to be honest ,1,0
sw2476B-ms98-a,9,B,35.4795,37.743375,2.263875,so that seems to be a pretty big change,1,0
sw2476B-ms98-a,27,B,106.419875,117.63075,11.210875,well i know the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because i think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you you know you protected the children and you,1,0
sw2476B-ms98-a,28,B,117.63075,130.47275,12.842,you want to be with the children yet there's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think oh but if we both work we can get a really big house and we can get two really nice cars we can take a vacation we can do this and,2,0
sw2476B-ms98-a,69,B,307.152,318.726625,11.574625,but i don't know if he took that out of his vacation or if they really do have a pater- he put paternity leave up there but it might have just been him describing the fact that he was taking vacation  to go be a father for a little while i don't know,1,0
sw2476B-ms98-a,77,B,344.6565,356.666125,12.009625,right well people they in general are just getting married a lot later i'm still single so i'm sure i'll be one of those parents that's you know one of those women in her thirties when when i get around to to ever getting married and then having kids ,1,0
sw2476B-ms98-a,85,B,380.719625,394.955,14.235375,i agree i think it also gives a woman a chance to if she does have a job and a career it gives the man and the wife both a chance to both be working and maybe save up some money and then it gives her a little more option if she wants to stay home with the children while they're young,1,0
sw2476B-ms98-a,86,B,394.955,408.43475,13.47975,and be a mother for awhile and then once they've gotten to school age maybe she could go back to work so she's kind of got that option if if they wait till later they've saved up some money that it's not as difficult for her to stay at home with the kids and live off one income or something,1,0
sw2477A-ms98-a,24,A,68.338875,73.97125,5.632375,uh i mean of course this year is a good year to be a a Chicago B- fan i guess because_1 they're doing pretty good,1,0
sw2477A-ms98-a,67,A,250.9095,258.106875,7.197375,i think that's going to be one of those that's uh that's won by the home team you know whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one i think,1,0
sw2477A-ms98-a,80,A,294.669875,307.86475,13.194875,he's yeah but he's been kind of up and down all year uh  you know one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in and then the next time he'll you know he can't seem to hit the side of a barn so i don't know i'm i'm kind of i'm not sure about him this year,1,0
sw2477A-ms98-a,119,A,422.305,430.243125,7.938125,um they're like i said they're doing extremely good right now Phoenix isn't doing too bad so it's it ought to be a real interesting play-off yeah ,1,0
sw2477B-ms98-a,67,B,237.02075,246.156,9.13525,i uh they'll make it you know i it's it's it's going to be a war between uh between Chicago and uh and uh and uh,1,0
sw2477B-ms98-a,69,B,248.125125,251.73825,3.613125,that's going to be a war it's going to be a great series,2,0
sw2477B-ms98-a,73,B,257.8675,262.222,4.3545,one of those two will probably be um in there,1,0
sw2477B-ms98-a,91,B,310.677375,315.0085,4.331125,and he's starting to be more consistent you know right at the right time of the year,1,0
sw2477B-ms98-a,96,B,328.357625,337.782,9.424375,he's got to be pretty much you know i use to say Akeem Olajuwon was the dominant player you know when  against any team he would dominate but,1,0
sw2478A-ms98-a,8,A,9.622125,13.317875,3.69575,it i- i got to uh this is going to be fun are you Republican or Democrat ,1,0
sw2478A-ms98-a,20,A,95.894875,106.679625,10.78475,they just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property and uh yeah there there there should be thousands of people in jail as far as i'm concerned ,1,0
sw2478A-ms98-a,32,A,166.672,173.085375,6.413375,uh be more than what you paid for it and they just never even got conservative with our money at all,1,0
sw2478A-ms98-a,46,A,244.848375,250.853375,6.005,oh yeah i i i agree with that but there's got to be some control and apparently there was you know,1,0
sw2478A-ms98-a,107,A,492.438875,504.632375,12.1935,if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty six billion it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes and so if that's true it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was that went down the tube somewhere,1,0
sw2478B-ms98-a,27,B,130.896875,134.53275,3.635875,much less for criminals that should be indicted,1,0
sw2478B-ms98-a,115,B,470.099375,472.382375,2.283,i would really be interested to know,1,0
sw2479A-ms98-a,53,A,148.93075,163.578,14.64725,you know i just couldn't wait to have kids and so if i was i was so anxious to have them and i couldn't wait to have them it would be kind of silly you know to go back to work as soon as i had them so so it it it it was really great by the end of the ten years i was really ready ,1,0
sw2479A-ms98-a,62,A,228.263625,236.897,8.633375,so now they're a year older and i my daughter's eleven going to be eleven this summer and my son will be nine and a half,2,0
sw2479A-ms98-a,74,A,320.4215,333.23925,12.81775,kindergarten next fall and she says this is it you know i'm not going to have her anymore and i said oh no don't count on that  after noon classes she's going to be here because she's going to morning kindergarten so,1,0
sw2479A-ms98-a,78,A,349.952875,358.658375,8.7055,well that's why we picked it because they were were supposed to be real great and you know i think they were fine but the the thing is he was in school all day ,1,0
sw2479A-ms98-a,82,A,373.644375,386.810125,13.16575,and then there would be a whole ton of other kids all in the same room you know and i- you know what having fun they had with these computer games and then they'd go outside for awhile they had snacks and story time and everything but it was just like going to school until five thirty at night ,1,0
sw2479A-ms98-a,83,A,386.810125,397.994,11.183875,instead of being able to get home at two thirty yeah because he was around with a crowd of kids and he just really missed being able to be by himself and having some  peace and quiet or you know ,1,0
sw2480A-ms98-a,17,A,79.74825,87.2975,7.54925,and uh i i look for in a restaurant i- they have to be courteous and clean you know that ,1,0
sw2480A-ms98-a,47,A,188.388125,195.20125,6.813125,oh  yeah i en- i uh and you know being on a budget the pri- it can't be real expensive either ,1,0
sw2480A-ms98-a,79,A,310.20325,319.3465,9.14325,oh yeah it does you know by the time you you go through the you know the spilling on the floor and the sit down and be quiet and quit yelling in the,1,0
sw2480B-ms98-a,111,B,417.29875,427.57175,10.273,oh oh we do oh there's there must be something in McDonald's food that little kids just can't do with out i just can not figure it out,1,0
sw2481A-ms98-a,68,A,256.18075,269.424375,13.243625,uh uh they'll ask you questions like do you know the defendant have you heard anything about the case do you have any uh specially if it's a murder case they may be asking for uh for a capital uh,1,0
sw2481A-ms98-a,75,A,291.161375,294.482375,3.321,th- you you have to be you have to be dead set against it,2,0
sw2481A-ms98-a,114,A,467.66425,471.748,4.08375,in in other words if you if you can just show that you're not going to be,1,0
sw2481A-ms98-a,115,A,471.748,476.3515,4.6035,that you can't be uh unbiased that's going to be enough,2,0
sw2481A-ms98-a,133,A,587.76225,593.342125,5.579875,but on the other hand i mean again what what can be done about it you know,1,0
sw2481B-ms98-a,29,B,171.788375,175.23,3.441625,well i'll tell you something i think ought to be changed,1,0
sw2481B-ms98-a,47,B,277.359875,286.246125,8.88625,well i cert- i believed in it in some s- you know cases but i would feel that it would be very hard for me to impose it on somebody,1,0
sw2481B-ms98-a,76,B,414.53525,415.961375,1.426125,i don't want to be picked,1,0
sw2481B-ms98-a,82,B,428.899875,436.061375,7.1615,i'm not going to be summoned i mean out of four hundred i'm not going to be one of the twelve especially see i put that down that that guy had told me that,2,0
sw2481B-ms98-a,92,B,507.796375,513.437125,5.64075,but something ought to be done because if you have money you get a good lawyer and you get off,1,0
sw2481B-ms98-a,94,B,563.5775,567.31475,3.73725,but if you've got a good lawyer he's going to be able to get more,1,0
sw2482A-ms98-a,57,A,110.155125,113.19175,3.036625,with every passing day we wonder if we will be,1,0
sw2482A-ms98-a,61,A,125.585,128.179,2.594,it's better to  to be employed,1,0
sw2482A-ms98-a,74,A,166.038625,170.493375,4.45475,they'd much rather be with friends friends are cool parents aren't,1,0
sw2482B-ms98-a,138,B,375.377125,390.0685,14.691375, this lady in our bass club we had a tournament yesterday and she was talking about her daughter said one week her daughter won't uh will be on a no meat kick and one week she'll eat nothing but Twix candy bars,1,0
sw2483A-ms98-a,3,A,17.002,29.4445,12.4425,yeah TI's got uh a lot of advances in it really uh hopefully this will turn out to be a good program for us we sure need uh the business okay current events uh y- you got the question you can go first here since i called,1,0
sw2483A-ms98-a,6,A,38.737125,50.152375,11.41525,an hour each way to work and so if i just use time and not in say one which quality is the best i g- that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio,1,0
sw2483A-ms98-a,7,A,50.152375,61.34275,11.190375,and then newspapers and TV would be tied after that because uh maybe i'll catch the the evening news like ten o'clock on TV and i  so that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper,1,0
sw2483A-ms98-a,63,A,435.832375,445.96675,10.134375,and then they would always say and look at this and there'd be pause you know and and you'd hear music and stuff and i realized it's the exact commentary that's you have on on the news yeah,1,0
sw2483B-ms98-a,25,B,204.25925,212.983375,8.724125,we have the advantage of being able to uh read and drive although there seems to be from what i've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving ,1,0
sw2483B-ms98-a,28,B,224.0915,236.0645,11.973,uh Newsweek magazine uh we tend to alternate between Newsweek and Time and whatever happens to be the the uh news magazine of the year for us and uh i read,1,0
sw2483B-ms98-a,66,B,520.263,528.69025,8.42725,uh watch uh fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news or our local news,1,0
sw2483B-ms98-a,69,B,552.279375,562.165375,9.886,uh at uh ten forty five because uh CNN would be wrapping their hourly coverage up and then we would get the local coverage uh,1,0
sw2484A-ms98-a,31,A,181.541125,185.549125,4.008,good grief that would be hard to do you know,1,0
sw2484A-ms98-a,46,A,304.032625,307.194625,3.162,well i wouldn't oh that would be hard,1,0
sw2484A-ms98-a,47,A,307.194625,312.728125,5.5335,it would be hard to sentence somebody to death if you weren't really really really sure,1,0
sw2484A-ms98-a,48,A,312.728125,315.97775,3.249625,you'd have to be really really really sure that he did it,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,9,B,12.505,18.8155,6.3105,no not at all and yet long enough if we were calling back and forth it would be a toll call  ,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,13,B,41.850125,47.613875,5.76375,sentencing and would all the jurors have to agree on okay that'd be a good place to start,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,34,B,131.781,139.197,7.416,he already said he's guilty so then then we go through the trial to determine what uh punishment should be meted out,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,37,B,159.54225,170.510875,10.968625,according to the law it can be no more or no le- uh no more or less than and he gave th- the number of years and he said it would also include a a possible fine,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,49,B,250.245125,260.131625,9.8865,and so it you know we felt a little better but i think if that could be in the hands of of someone who knew the law and could be privy to that information seems like it would be fairer,3,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,53,B,276.376875,279.729125,3.35225,it n- now it may be on some,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,56,B,286.466875,298.4335,11.966625, were dealing with uh with the state laws not necessarily  not necessarily federal that may have something to do with it and it may be too that if it were um a capital crime,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,57,B,298.4335,303.30175,4.86825,uh capital murder or something like that that that it may be different ,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,65,B,344.187375,355.018125,10.83075,uh qualities and couldn't be rehabilitated and they were they were really upset that he was getting off so lightly for the heinous crime that he had been involved in,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,75,B,391.758375,396.90625,5.147875,i'd be more than happy to let the judge determine the uh the sentencing,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,97,B,463.787375,466.497875,2.7105,y- i- i can see how that would be difficult,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,99,B,469.623375,476.157,6.533625, before you go oh that would be tough,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,104,B,495.29325,498.42725,3.134,that the- there should be a- agreement,1,0
sw2484B-ms98-a,110,B,521.94375,532.58125,10.6375,i would a whole lot rather go through the expense of another trial because of a hung jury than that a justice not be meted out correctly,1,0
sw2485A-ms98-a,52,A,158.842125,170.14975,11.307625,not be able to do it so did people come like from out of town to the reunion or they did did you put them_1 up in other peoples houses or did you have hotel rooms or how'd you do it,1,0
sw2485A-ms98-a,65,A,214.86175,223.091125,8.229375,you know there'd be one person who lived there that would have a house but they couldn't put everybody up so it i think it would get kind of expensive,1,0
sw2485A-ms98-a,81,A,257.5585,267.887,10.3285,see that would be great because_1 then you could spend so much more time together than if you all were in your own hotels or something and then every time you wanted to go eat,1,0
sw2485A-ms98-a,108,A,333.177125,336.644,3.466875,that'd be great that'd be really nice,2,0
sw2485A-ms98-a,150,A,447.2,461.05725,13.85725,sure sure no that would just be a few but how about like because of divorce and stuff like that like my parents are divorced and they're both remarried and you know there i mean there's i don't know,1,0
sw2485B-ms98-a,21,B,101.200125,114.245875,13.04575,yeah that's what that's what happened when i when i first uh met my husband i said this can't be you know nobody can have this many relatives because_1 a lot of them_1 lived in like a group you know down one highway,1,0
sw2485B-ms98-a,65,B,403.255,415.134625,11.879625,you know some of them_1 if they didn't have their addresses and all on and you know they told them_1 that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information we had to tell them_1 how many people were going to be coming,1,0
sw2485B-ms98-a,66,B,415.134625,428.916,13.781375,you know and then when they when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter it uh  you know to get the information and all it asked you know will you be willing to bring and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring,2,0
sw2485B-ms98-a,84,B,514.954,525.031125,10.077125,it was like five or six dollars i can't remember exactly you know that we paid for the book to be printed and it's not uh it's not a hard back book it's just a,1,0
sw2485B-ms98-a,86,B,534.8375,539.174875,4.337375,and it'll be something my kids will have you know just like,1,0
sw2486A-ms98-a,4,A,27.008875,40.104,13.095125,but that was just me i know many people are co- very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants uh it i guess i was just old enough not to uh be very comfortable in it how about_1 you,1,0
sw2486A-ms98-a,16,A,90.777125,105.247625,14.4705,and i think that does make a difference because when you do have to be in front of people uh i think you the the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and and uh more classical style of clothing ,1,0
sw2486A-ms98-a,23,A,147.647625,161.40375,13.756125,well there are miniskirts and there are miniskirts there are some that are really short and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person,1,0
sw2486A-ms98-a,28,A,193.083875,204.20325,11.119375,in my class and uh  way i always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad ,1,0
sw2486A-ms98-a,37,A,244.93525,259.323625,14.388375,uh again maybe because i was at the school there were still many teachers who wore miniskirts uh we had no regulation against it and a lot of the kids did of course and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers,1,0
sw2486A-ms98-a,41,A,282.487875,287.428,4.940125,uh i don't like that i don't i think there should be individuality in dressing,1,0
sw2486A-ms98-a,47,A,303.4395,310.1785,6.739,well i and i don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to to look professional,1,0
sw2486A-ms98-a,49,A,324.524,339.50125,14.97725,in the workplace uh but that that you can have a classical look without a lot of a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine because that was one thing i always fought against i started out as a physical education teacher,1,0
sw2486A-ms98-a,53,A,366.91525,377.272375,10.357125,and what have you uh and be very comfortable but when i go out somewhere then uh unless i have a pair of dress slacks i don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans,1,0
sw2486A-ms98-a,55,A,390.036125,398.124625,8.0885,but uh there are certain norms that companies should be able to uh put out as guidelines for their employees,1,0
sw2486B-ms98-a,14,B,64.34375,78.383875,14.040125,it it uh definitely fluctuates mainly with what i'm going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is and when it's raining i'm more likely to wear jeans and and when it's really cold i'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or that type of thing,1,0
sw2486B-ms98-a,65,B,296.298375,304.811625,8.51325,not you know you don't want to over do it but just a little a touch of it just to say yes i am a  but i can be professional too,1,0
sw2486B-ms98-a,87,B,416.463875,431.154875,14.691,the only real restrictions they have are uh no halter tops and no shorts even the long walking short of the squirts the the split skirts anything that that could be considered shorts they don't allow and they don't allow um,1,0
sw2486B-ms98-a,89,B,437.144625,450.0705,12.925875,other than that it's pretty pretty lax and i think that's good because it does allow people to be individual and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day or you know if you want to be comfortable and casual you can and sometimes i think you,2,0
sw2486B-ms98-a,90,B,450.0705,456.27825,6.20775,may be more productive if you're comfortable with what your wearing and can be be feel more relaxed whereas uh,3,0
sw2486B-ms98-a,91,B,456.27825,471.2475,14.96925,sometimes when your in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and you're not you know maybe you don't uh can't get as comfortable to sit down and you know like when i'm writing training material i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day,1,0
sw2487A-ms98-a,33,A,124.0985,136.38325,12.28475,they tend to be very reliable and uh people that uh own them uh typically have them serviced on a regular maintenance schedule i think they're kept in uh better condition than uh most other cars,1,0
sw2487A-ms98-a,109,A,563.9585,570.025375,6.066875,and uh i'd be looking more of uh more for a luxury sedan something with a little more status,1,0
sw2487A-ms98-a,111,A,575.2635,587.63525,12.37175,i really don't consider it to be a status symbol uh it's just uh i'm interested i know people who have cars of that nature and uh they tend to hold their quality ,1,0
sw2487B-ms98-a,3,B,2.06925,13.289875,11.220625,no i'm not uh and i won't be for a while it's kind of called not having the money but  i always like to look at what's out there are you looking at cars right now,1,0
sw2487B-ms98-a,46,B,171.74825,180.775625,9.027375,i definitely would chose a car on on what appeals to me as far as looks but it'd have to be dependable uh,1,0
sw2487B-ms98-a,48,B,188.71,190.220375,1.510375,it it'd have to be,1,0
sw2487B-ms98-a,65,B,272.061375,282.22975,10.168375, you know   it's just too good to and then maybe when i go out and look in in the car market i'll be able to get what i really want and,1,0
sw2487B-ms98-a,96,B,432.45875,435.187625,2.728875,how soon do you think you'll be purchasing a car,1,0
sw2488A-ms98-a,10,A,30.933,36.82525,5.89225,i think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman ,1,0
sw2488A-ms98-a,145,A,529.07,532.221375,3.151375,it's going to be reduced right uh-huh,1,0

sw2488B-ms98-a,65,B,267.356125,276.64825,9.292125,cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard then are y- can can you be helped   i have i have my doubts you know,1,0

sw2488B-ms98-a,105,B,505.769,516.97275,11.20375,and i don't know what needs to be done you know it seems like there's no room in jails to put them_1 in jail and when they do put them_1 in there you know we- i'm taking a business law class at night and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney and,1,0
sw2488B-ms98-a,116,B,561.778125,570.100625,8.3225,and we're going to have to say if you commit this crime and if we're sure you commit this crime you are going to be sentenced to death period,1,0

sw2489A-ms98-a,105,A,412.10625,419.903875,7.797625,and uh they're always talking about how they rode the the those inner tubes down the river and that sounded like a fun that'd be a fun weekend ,1,0

sw2490A-ms98-a,108,A,404.519625,414.779125,10.2595,i mean because_1 he's always you know if he's has them_1 out cleaning them_1 you know she can be there and he'll tell her how he's doing it or you know show her the insides and stuff like that,1,0
sw2490A-ms98-a,110,A,416.20375,417.79525,1.5915,to be feared and,1,0

sw2490B-ms98-a,3,B,5.23425,18.89,13.65575,i don't know i'm thinking about what from one to ten what my number would be it'd probably be somewhere closer to uh less control because_1 i don't see i'm not a member of the NRA although my father is but,2,0
sw2490B-ms98-a,5,B,28.978,42.74425,13.76625,and i think that's a dumb situation because there has got to be some kind of background check to see that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose you know if if if you're going to hunt with it if you're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week,1,0
sw2490B-ms98-a,6,B,42.74425,54.087125,11.342875,it's not a big deal for them to go if they can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket you know i mean they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of psychiatric record armed you know felony record you know,1,0
sw2490B-ms98-a,24,B,134.77,143.7575,8.9875, i ima- i imagine his his opinion is a little bit towards the one there on the scale of one to ten he needs some more gosh if i was a cop i'd be,1,0
sw2490B-ms98-a,27,B,149.498125,157.568625,8.0705,and i i guess i think the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is there should be some law against the types of gu- i mean,1,0
sw2490B-ms98-a,33,B,186.888125,198.5235,11.635375,and and especially some of the minority children whether you know a racist or not that's the truth and and if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands and a cop comes up,1,0
sw2490B-ms98-a,59,B,361.18125,373.786375,12.605125,yeah put the safety on the gun don't assume always assume it's loaded that's that's got to be the most common thing that people yeah it's oh it's empty it's empty boom you know ,1,0
sw2490B-ms98-a,72,B,416.814375,428.516375,11.702,curi- yeah not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared of if it if it's just one more piece of something but but they've got to understand like you said never touch it but yeah,2,0
sw2490B-ms98-a,74,B,432.20375,440.473,8.26925,and then the shells are in another part and i- sometimes i think about it a- and i got it because my husband used to travel and be out of he was out of country one time for three months,1,0
sw2490B-ms98-a,91,B,552.423625,564.020375,11.59675,we're we're in pretty good agreement actually on it it would be an interesting it would be even more interesting you you to to meet some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum that's ,2,0
sw2491A-ms98-a,2,A,0.88425,13.460875,12.576625,we built our home in what was a brand new subdivision in nineteen sixty five and we were the fourth lot in this subdivision to be built on,1,0
sw2491B-ms98-a,30,B,168.838125,180.00075,11.162625,oh probably November December until March or April i guess around April and then i went ahead and built the breezeway and the garage because_1 i thought it was too cold to be pouring concrete outside in the winter time,1,0
sw2491B-ms98-a,94,B,516.24375,523.195,6.95125,sure if you sell it for that price whatever you have to buy is going to be inflated by that same amount so there's really not an advantage to it,1,0
sw2492A-ms98-a,63,A,323.3225,327.987375,4.664875,and so i'd like to do that i have a feeling i'll be out there all the time ,1,0

sw2493B-ms98-a,62,B,352.330125,367.2195,14.889375,to talk to the reporters and stuff you know and how does it feel be you know to get her off the hook and this and that and they he went out there knowing that she was really guilty  so that kind of thing so it's a fun show then i like comedies also like uh,1,0

sw2494A-ms98-a,58,A,214.373125,222.71325,8.340125,i really don't know what the solution would be everybody  or a lot of people thought when they ended the poll tax you know many years ago that that would bring out you know a lot of voters,1,0
sw2494A-ms98-a,59,A,222.71325,229.553125,6.839875,i don't know maybe it maybe it should be stressed through you know public education in schools you know or something i don't know,1,0
sw2494A-ms98-a,73,A,269.97075,277.6905,7.71975,yeah i don't know really know what a solution would be i really don't you know like you say if you  if you do everything but fill out the card for them that's really about all you can do uh-huh,1,0
sw2494A-ms98-a,92,A,312.314125,319.196875,6.88275,don't really know what a what a real solution would be for it except you know  like you say some sort sort of an educational process ,1,0
sw2494B-ms98-a,19,B,92.14725,100.12575,7.9785,that's how they get the jury uh rolls from from voter registration but i think that's going to be changed,1,0
sw2494B-ms98-a,34,B,159.598875,172.598625,12.99975,yeah it's i- i would imagine it would be pretty i have uh a friend of mine whose her son-in-law is a judge and i've gone to a a few things with her,1,0
sw2494B-ms98-a,40,B,191.727875,197.117125,5.38925,what so do you think there's any what what could be done to improve the,1,0
sw2494B-ms98-a,48,B,235.2575,244.351125,9.093625,um he didn't want to he did he said he couldn't afford to be off from work because_1 they did not pay pay them for being off from work and that's why he didn't register but,1,0
sw2495A-ms98-a,13,A,74.9755,80.812375,5.836875, and even the painter couldn't give me a good estimate he said well i'll be done this afternoon you know,1,0
sw2495A-ms98-a,14,A,80.812375,93.58725,12.774875,and pretty soon before you know it you know he's run into so many problems and it's just there's nothing there to be a problem i thought but um it just took him so much longer and,1,0
sw2495B-ms98-a,2,B,3.95875,18.926875,14.968125, well  i don't i haven't done any painting since i was a child and my father would be painting and i'd ask him if i could  you know take a turn or something but uh when we bought our home it was recently,1,0

sw2495B-ms98-a,37,B,177.510375,182.394375,4.884, it was like ten times longer than he already thought he would be done and ,1,0
sw2495B-ms98-a,94,B,433.1965,440.082625,6.886125,well you too i guess it's ge- getting to be lunch time i need to go take care of the kids but you have a good day,1,0

sw2496B-ms98-a,122,B,591.583125,600.549,8.965875,there must be a lot of people with a lot of money who just like to go out and shop because we have plentitude of shopping malls within like a five mile radius i,1,0
sw2497A-ms98-a,4,A,13.43,22.737375,9.307375,is that right yeah w- we uh we thought the opposite we thought well it's going to be TI people and i think they went to customers you know people that use TI computers and everything which is fine,1,0
sw2497A-ms98-a,8,A,28.631125,43.411,14.779875,actually they don't talk about much uh of what it's for but my wife keeps keeps ask asking me and i'm saying well your computer is eventually going to just answer your voice you know they're they're of course it's uh very obvious for people with handicaps but in general i guess it would be faster,1,0
sw2497A-ms98-a,13,A,65.9965,71.912875,5.916375,they're going to take it much further and i guess in aircraft and all that a lot of it is going to be like you talk to the computer like,1,0
sw2497A-ms98-a,48,A,260.969625,274.892875,13.92325,and i bet they have a lot of metrics there i think that uh the only emotional part might be in miles you know mile signs but that that's that could be last anyway maybe pick a year two thousand say okay we'll slowly change but i think,2,0
sw2497B-ms98-a,3,B,5.900875,15.413375,9.5125,yeah yeah i i didn't know that we were going to be talking to mostly TI folks i thought it was all scattered out among graduate schools or something yeah,1,0
sw2497B-ms98-a,25,B,91.283,101.490125,10.207125,um i know it causes a problem for industry in a li- in a small way but nothing that won't be overcome in a little bit of time ,1,0
sw2497B-ms98-a,56,B,281.217125,290.443875,9.22675,because for so long people are going are going to be able to equate miles to kilometers i mean when you drive around Europe you do the same thing,1,0
sw2497B-ms98-a,59,B,305.787375,316.68625,10.898875,yeah i i i it's silly i don't i don't think that we ought to be any different it causes a lot of problems a lot of times between uh different countries in their manufacturing stuff and,1,0
sw2497B-ms98-a,97,B,552.747875,562.574,9.826125,and uh decided well i don't really want to be a lawyer i mean i knew that going in i just wanted a law degree because it would open all kinds of doors but,1,0
sw2498A-ms98-a,38,A,195.29275,199.509875,4.217125,and that shouldn't be that way either uh,1,0
sw2498A-ms98-a,39,A,199.509875,203.996,4.486125,the power given to those people is just well beyond it should be,1,0
sw2498A-ms98-a,58,A,269.929375,273.826125,3.89675,will have to be probably scrapped,1,0
sw2498A-ms98-a,59,A,273.826125,275.701875,1.87575,but that's going to be difficult,1,0
sw2498B-ms98-a,3,B,12.174125,24.251125,12.077,uh so i would basically say the way to fix the budget is to uh cut and eliminate taxes charge user fees for things that uh are absolutely necessary and to be allocated fairly that way,1,0
sw2498B-ms98-a,11,B,58.477,62.2775,3.8005,so uh a dollar tax isn't isn't a dollar that can be,1,0
sw2498B-ms98-a,27,B,161.045625,163.66475,2.619125,the art's in humanity should be privately funded,1,0
sw2498B-ms98-a,28,B,163.66475,174.0845,10.41975,um a lot of these social welfare programs i mean that's why they're things like United Way is when you and i think that those are important but we give our dollars to them and it shouldn't be a government responsibility,1,0
sw2498B-ms98-a,29,B,174.0845,179.98525,5.90075,but the government i think is supposed to be doing is is defending our rights,1,0
sw2498B-ms98-a,43,B,225.69925,235.8125,10.11325,give people a concrete get people to agree on a concrete idea of just exactly what government is supposed to be doing for them no more no less and cut government back down to that size,1,0
sw2498B-ms98-a,47,B,249.952125,254.238625,4.2865,oh sure and and there's going to be a lot of you know cover your ass and,1,0
sw2499A-ms98-a,110,A,545.653375,550.17475,4.521375,a lot of a lot of people did but it would have to be a good show,1,0
sw2499B-ms98-a,13,B,54.921375,59.154625,4.23325, it's supposed to be good though i know some friends who went to see it,1,0
sw2499B-ms98-a,31,B,121.397375,131.7935,10.396125,oh i know it was well i ended up at the theater and there was didn't seem to be anything else on  i wanted to see so i'll try that but it wasn't worth anything i didn't care for that at all,1,0

sw2499B-ms98-a,79,B,309.58525,320.156,10.57075,it's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore and i'm just i guess i'm just middle America or something i just go to be entertained and,1,0
sw2500A-ms98-a,1,A,0,4.5745,4.5745,child care seems to be uh a uh topic that,1,0
sw2500A-ms98-a,3,A,17.24075,28.477375,11.236625,and i guess it'd depend on the the age of the child the needs of the child how long the child has to be there if it's a five day a week deal i would certainly look a lot harder than if it was just a couple of days a month,1,0
sw2500A-ms98-a,9,A,79.431,86.8155,7.3845,they just averaged it all out but most kids stay until about six so it will be about ten dollars which will cover the ride and cover the hours you stay,1,0
sw2500A-ms98-a,16,A,140.515,152.683,12.168,an appointment say at eight thirty and she has to be all the way across town at her office at eight thirty then she needs to have them ride the bus one way and i'll get off in time to hopefully pick both of them up and not have the day care center in the other direction,1,0

sw2500A-ms98-a,73,A,491.06125,495.2705,4.20925,well i guess they haven't had the i don't know what the incentive would be but,1,0

sw2501A-ms98-a,38,A,215.4055,227.736625,12.331125,it comes off in strips i mean not even little bit so we still have some of that trim work to do because we       we know what a job it's gonna be because_1 you almost have to strip the whole thing in order do it again,1,0
sw2501B-ms98-a,2,B,12.96075,21.657375,8.696625,uh painting is not hard to do uh as long as it's not in not to the point of where it's uh needs to be scraped and bl- and peeling,1,0

sw2507A-ms98-a,31,A,172.786125,186.335375,13.54925,a news story about uh gun control and in Florida they have started something where you know you always have to be eighteen or twenty one to buy a gun but um they've started where they do a background check and so,1,0
sw2507A-ms98-a,83,A,487.130875,491.564875,4.434,yeah because_1 she might be um apt to go get it a little quicker than,1,0

sw2529B-ms98-a,45,B,254.183,267.09225,12.90925,and uh i- i think they don't go far enough uh kind of on a different vein and that is that i think every time we have any type of industrial accident at TI i think somebody ought to be tested immediately,1,0
sw2529B-ms98-a,86,B,479.750625,487.112375,7.36175,well now if the lab is making an error on the sample then when they retest the error should not be there,1,0

sw2531A-ms98-a,56,A,240.607625,252.007875,11.40025,hum-um it should be never it should that should have a cutoff time just like uh uh statutes of limits and ever- all that other stuff you know they they should have like within one year,1,0
sw2531A-ms98-a,65,A,296.7445,309.527375,12.782875,so  i don't know it is uh it's getting to be more business now rather than uh actually uh dealing with the crime than with uh um,1,0
sw2531A-ms98-a,68,A,322.9145,336.3905,13.476,have an equal amount of you know maybe they can have a few but i think most of them should be not uh lawyers in the fact and that's way way they've gotten into politics  because of the the law things you know the loops and everything,1,0
sw2531A-ms98-a,72,A,366.031625,372.272,6.240375,and whoever that may be whether it's a robbery or drugs or whatever else um,1,0
sw2531A-ms98-a,88,A,491.07725,499.541375,8.464125,i'm not sure which way to take to shake up the system bad enough to start making some reforms sure would be nice to see it happening soon,1,0
sw2531A-ms98-a,89,A,499.541375,506.759375,7.218,because it's obvious that uh pretty soon they're not going to be able to handle you know all of the crime that there is,1,0
sw2531A-ms98-a,93,A,511.398375,518.36375,6.965375,it must be especially frustrating to you having do you work there now or is was this uh uh was this before,1,0
sw2531A-ms98-a,94,A,518.36375,526.80725,8.4435,oh okay so it's just another job uh it must be especially frustrating because even your rights in there  are,1,0
sw2531A-ms98-a,98,A,538.3835,548.137875,9.754375,and they have more freedom i mean i understand that i mean i'm not i mean you can't be everywhere all the time and i'm sure that they have searches and everything but i mean,1,0
sw2531A-ms98-a,100,A,553.963,560.676875,6.713875,to me it'd be like walking around in a time   the time even just being there you know just working there um ,1,0
sw2531A-ms98-a,101,A,560.676875,568.144125,7.46725,because you never know if you're going to get knifed or something uh you know as a guard that it must be scary  uh,1,0
sw2531B-ms98-a,3,B,10.317375,16.045625,5.72825,the problem goes all the way back to the entire criminal justice system needs to be reworked,1,0
sw2531B-ms98-a,54,B,403.628125,417.507625,13.8795,get to such an extent where the average American citizen if they see a crime go down or a crime is happening against them they're not going to worry about trying to get a policeman they're not going to worry about it because they're going to be packing their own heat and they're going to take care of business themselves ,1,0
sw2533A-ms98-a,10,A,62.43125,65.09,2.65875,right he's supposed to be able to do that,1,0
sw2533B-ms98-a,48,B,186.209625,196.033375,9.82375,yeah he makes good money too doing that you'd be sh- i was shocked but anyway someone gave an Iranian a tip of four Rangers tickets last year,1,0
sw2533B-ms98-a,92,B,388.357125,400.504375,12.14725,or nine and under they're all real young they're just really feel like that's what God's told them to do but they're not condemning you if you we only have one child you know they don't say they don't put airs on about it or anything which is good because it would be easy i'm sure for them to do that,1,0
sw2533B-ms98-a,102,B,494.4065,506.34075,11.93425,the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work they just come out of the Bible and so this book it just really ties in all these things and how to train the child so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen,1,0
sw2533B-ms98-a,103,B,506.34075,516.950125,10.609375,you know what i mean how to train them so they're going to be a blessing and so you know they do that and they they just live lean pretty much they don't she doesn't shop at Foley's you know and stuff like that,1,0
sw2534A-ms98-a,45,A,188.680875,196.943875,8.263,um yeah yeah because they they like to get in and fertilize things too but uh why would it be illegal,1,0
sw2534A-ms98-a,102,A,504.170625,518.65625,14.485625,and and that she has a whole bunch of kittens but we have to be careful uh you know we have to get a particular color point uh stud you can't just breed them with anything we have to get a uh we have to get a silver point {himmy},1,0
sw2534A-ms98-a,103,A,518.65625,522.780875,4.124625,so the silver will be predominate in the kittens,1,0
sw2534B-ms98-a,2,B,2.024375,8.134125,6.10975,well i like gardening a lot i like to be outside um,1,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,17,A,95.900125,102.5215,6.621375,i don't know Frisco there always seemed to be a lot of drugs in Frisco for as small a town as it was there were a lot of drugs,1,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,18,A,102.5215,110.767125,8.245625,but as far as major crime there didn't seem to be as you know one of those nice little small towns and nothing ever happened and it would be nice to kind of get back into that so,2,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,20,A,122.188,132.257,10.069,and one of the things that we kind of got to talking about is you know what is it we can do you know what can what can be done to stop it and i'm not sure that i know the answer to that question,1,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,21,A,132.257,144.01525,11.75825,you know i mean one of the things that we talked about that i truly believe is you know you give somebody a you know a jury convicts somebody and they give them_1 a sixty year sentence and the guys going to be out in twelve or thirteen years you know,1,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,23,A,153.24525,165.08175,11.8365,and you know so he does this like everyday you know deals with this and he said you know you could pretty much if you sit on a jury know right now you could be sure that they will serve just about a quarter of whatever you give them_1 you know,1,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,26,A,184.89675,195.347125,10.450375,i mean we're going to be out in a couple of years this is no big deal i mean this is like a little vacation we don't have to work we don't have to you know we don't have to worry about making a living we're you know we're fed and we're clothed and we're you know this is no big deal and ,1,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,45,A,293.002125,300.298625,7.2965,and i want to sit on the front row when it happens i want to be there i want to watch it you know and you can't blame her for feeling that vindictive you know i mean,1,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,52,A,347.90475,357.988375,10.083625,i don't know and these poor children are going to be fatherless forever and this guy ought chances are he he'll be out he'll be walking the streets and it's just doesn't,3,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,62,A,424.8335,430.710625,5.877125,it really is i heard something that their supposed to be starting a huge campaign in New York about um,1,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,63,A,430.710625,440.507,9.796375,child abuse and stopping child abuse and it's supposed to be like it's starting there supposed to be like a big nationwide campaign and you know so hopefully that will take off and really do something i don't know there's just,2,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,76,A,495.2775,500.580875,5.303375,they're going to be stealing cars at sixteen and robbing houses at twenty one you know if it doesn't stop,1,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,79,A,511.25525,522.8905,11.63525,to heck with them you know the police asked me if i wanted to press charges and i said no i'm not going to press charges i wanted the boys parents to know what had happened and i want you to go to talk to their parents and i want you know th- their parents to be aware,1,0
sw2535A-ms98-a,83,A,530.39525,543.36725,12.972,this is exactly what i told my mom you know when it was all over i said if we had a decent set of parents here those boys will be back here this afternoon with money to repay the eggs and with a big apology and nothing,1,0
sw2535B-ms98-a,66,B,225.087,233.473625,8.386625,and then people forget you know th- you hear oh this person's going to be put to death but you don't they don't tell you what this person has done,1,0
sw2535B-ms98-a,81,B,284.774375,286.515625,1.74125,wouldn't that be horrible,1,0
sw2535B-ms98-a,103,B,339.425,344.910375,5.485375,and how a five year old can grasp something like that is be- is just a uh,1,0
sw2535B-ms98-a,108,B,353.885125,355.526375,1.64125,will be out,1,0

sw2535B-ms98-a,135,B,439.591625,449.957375,10.36575,that would be nice but you know it's like the big drug campaigns that you hear every once in a while they the big hype is at first and then it just kind of fizzles and dies,1,0
sw2535B-ms98-a,148,B,498.17625,503.23925,5.063,well you've got to be held accountable for your actions no matter how old you are or what it is,1,0
sw2536A-ms98-a,90,A,292.02775,301.5645,9.53675,and i said yeah this will be handy because i can use this for all my business expenses so i used it went on a went on a trip and used it got the bill and paid it,1,0
sw2536A-ms98-a,149,A,498.854,500.384,1.53,don't be crazy,1,0
sw2536A-ms98-a,167,A,595.61075,599.73,4.11925,yeah and i mean one day you know i might be able to get,1,0
sw2536B-ms98-a,37,B,105.73,109.40975,3.67975,i'll go ahead and and charge it knowing that the money will be there,1,0
sw2536B-ms98-a,159,B,447.96375,454.54075,6.577,so uh they both can be nice around Christmas time and stuff if you're going to buy a TV or uh or uh  electronic,1,0
sw2537A-ms98-a,7,A,48.225,60.50025,12.27525,want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing and and you know obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth but i don't really like having to do it,2,0
sw2537A-ms98-a,18,A,142.96925,156.119125,13.149875,plus i guess if they are in trouble enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time then the company has lost what they've put into that employee and their expertise or whatever,1,0
sw2537A-ms98-a,22,A,166.496,176.483625,9.987625,well do you think that um it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or,1,0
sw2537A-ms98-a,23,A,176.483625,185.31175,8.828125,do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it,1,0
sw2537A-ms98-a,43,A,377.582,383.193125,5.611125,then that would be one thing but i think it's too minor and too,1,0
sw2537A-ms98-a,48,A,435.790375,450.258,14.467625,well yes that yes i- i think that could be a big problem you know i would just be irate if they said it was   i knew it wasn't you know that just really rub me the wrong way,2,0
sw2537B-ms98-a,17,B,124.97625,134.732375,9.756125,oh you've got some people could be arrested for uh drug use drug dealings and things like that and uh if their if their employers,1,0
sw2537B-ms98-a,42,B,329.4255,342.9385,13.513,you know if you hired me i'll be you know supposedly you agreed with a majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so uh you know let's let's stick with that original trust i guess huh,1,0
sw2537B-ms98-a,68,B,520.24975,533.907125,13.657375,you know any of the any of the ones we would we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists but uh um there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and that can happen but uh,2,0
sw2538A-ms98-a,4,A,28.1615,39.8655,11.704,his and he thought or predicted that Poland would be one of the first ones to start seeing uh both in forms of debt forgiven and uh actual dollar values given over to them,1,0
sw2538A-ms98-a,6,A,45.154,52.340375,7.186375,so i don't know if that's going to be an ongoing trend that we're going to start helping this country and that country and breaking our own backs as it were,1,0
sw2538A-ms98-a,17,A,136.0125,146.48425,10.47175,far as Roosevelt and say that the social programs have certainly gone up and only economics have caused a few cutbacks but still the desire seems to be that the government s-,1,0
sw2538A-ms98-a,20,A,155.680375,164.442625,8.76225,that's a that's an interesting thought that they're headed to be a socialist and they're headed to be democratic and maybe we're capitalist and maybe the two will meet in the middle and and,2,0
sw2538A-ms98-a,25,A,193.012875,202.85825,9.845375,right that does seem to be a problem that even the Poles faced when uh i think they're one of the earliest experimenters in in trying to get a capitalist uh economy going and,1,0
sw2538A-ms98-a,26,A,202.85825,209.510625,6.652375,some of the things that showed up is um i hate the term worth it work ethic but that seems to be the one that's tied to it,1,0
sw2538A-ms98-a,27,A,209.510625,223.827,14.316375,that some of the Poles just didn't know what it meant to get up in the morning and you know be there and put in a few extra hours if it needed it or you know a little bit of work here and work there do what it takes instead of just stamp the clock stamp the clock and forget about it give me my paycheck,1,0
sw2538A-ms98-a,40,A,317.540125,321.279625,3.7395,i don't know if it'd be a political trend or not to,1,0
sw2538B-ms98-a,5,B,52.65975,66.1365,13.47675,well i think that's uh a you know valid observation that uh anytime that a company that a country appears to be uh moving in the same direction that the United States,1,0
sw2538B-ms98-a,9,B,88.416875,93.764125,5.34725,us giving aid is the right uh right thing for our government to be doing,1,0
sw2538B-ms98-a,12,B,110.6825,118.395875,7.713375,whereas in our own economy the trend seems to be more towards social programs,1,0
sw2538B-ms98-a,25,B,166.226,175.091875,8.865875,and i'm not sure that uh that i would even think at this point that somewhere in the middle would even be desirable because uh i mean if there's if there's something,1,0

sw2557A-ms98-a,132,A,578.90525,586.86325,7.958,and i know people would be willing to do more like saving their newspapers and that if they had a place to take them we don't have anyplace right now,1,0
sw2557B-ms98-a,3,B,5.048125,7.42525,2.377125,oh well that'll be nice though,1,0
sw2557B-ms98-a,59,B,274.7585,288.397625,13.639125,um and it doesn't all have to be like white they'll take colored folders and and uh even some of those can have plastic tabs on them so it's it's hard to kind of figure out,1,0
sw2557B-ms98-a,69,B,373.62225,383.225625,9.603375,yeah that wouldn't be so bad um our grocery store like yours will take the uh plastic bags and they'll also take the the paper bags back,1,0
sw2558A-ms98-a,9,A,76.16,88.09975,11.93975,yeah the the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be like a draft,3,0
sw2558A-ms98-a,13,A,123.435625,135.161,11.725375,but i just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them uh sorting them out assigning them training them would be insurmountable,1,0
sw2558A-ms98-a,18,A,150.307375,156.636375,6.329,well i think that in the in the cases that like that uh they had to be,1,0
sw2558A-ms98-a,30,A,209.368375,220.2975,10.929125,and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization but on the other hand i'm not sure what the permanent value of it was i don't know what we got for all the money,1,0
sw2558A-ms98-a,41,A,282.0485,287.628,5.5795,yeah well what about a voluntary program do you think that would be a good idea,1,0
sw2558A-ms98-a,45,A,312.97275,324.436375,11.463625,yeah out here in California there's a program like that for uh juvenile delinquents the the ones that are not dangerous and they don't have to be locked up go to these uh camps,1,0
sw2558A-ms98-a,47,A,335.217,345.33025,10.11325,and that i know is run by the State but there may be other things i'm not so sure what kind of uh training that is for the future for those kids,1,0
sw2558B-ms98-a,9,B,51.51725,59.818,8.30075,right yeah i the my first impression was um it would be v- very good i think it would be good for people to serve but,2,0
sw2558B-ms98-a,10,B,59.818,71.41475,11.59675,i don't know if it should be an option it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the Depression or coming out of the Depression available for kids and i think there are some,2,0
sw2558B-ms98-a,45,B,198.5475,203.293,4.7455,plus the training involved yeah that would be expensive in most cases,1,0
sw2558B-ms98-a,59,B,251.22975,259.8055,8.57575,and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me it taught me not to be so self-centered and it you know to think of others,1,0
sw2558B-ms98-a,83,B,354.762375,367.761375,12.999,right especially in you know if you take a a child that's from the inner city and then put them in the a middle of a park if they go back to the inner city they may not see trees for a while much less be able to take care of them ,1,0
sw2559A-ms98-a,22,A,129.227,137.32075,8.09375,not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody i s- suppose because it you can easily be overheard overheard,1,0
sw2559A-ms98-a,23,A,137.32075,145.325125,8.004375,and they get i suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen,1,0

sw2559A-ms98-a,46,A,255.126,260.405625,5.279625,that's no secret and it shouldn't be that way i don't think,1,0
sw2559A-ms98-a,53,A,282.77475,291.321,8.54625,the only thing really that can be changed is for us to everybody to say we've had enough of you out you go but,1,0
sw2559A-ms98-a,54,A,291.321,306.022,14.701,uh i don't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that it has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done um,2,0

sw2560A-ms98-a,14,A,61.65025,75.512,13.86175,um-hum um-hum um it almost makes you kind of think about things it gives you a different way of thinking them because you you're you're in you you know that you always wonder and when you see something like that that kind of well hey well maybe it could be that way,1,0
sw2560B-ms98-a,17,B,75.428875,84.36725,8.938375,right maybe it's really maybe i should take life more seriously and  and be a little bit more careful but uh yep um,1,0

sw2561A-ms98-a,93,A,482,490.082125,8.082125,but you know when i see them i don't know that i could  when i think of my parents who fortunately shouldn't be close to getting there yet but i don't  think of,1,0
sw2561A-ms98-a,118,A,584.77,589.862625,5.092625,but it's just a scary thought every ti- i certainly don't want to be like that someday,1,0
sw2561B-ms98-a,93,B,388.375125,396.9625,8.587375,uh you know they do they do a halfway decent job but i- it seems like they're they're they tend to be kind of slack,1,0
sw2561B-ms98-a,108,B,427.182125,431.033375,3.85125,well me neither but but it just seems like that's what it would be like,1,0

sw2563A-ms98-a,35,A,216.36,229.133125,12.773125,you know makes for a habit that has to be supported at a rate that uh can't be supported by uh that person as far as working goes i mean you can't be that much into drugs and still hold down a job capable of paying for that much drugs so,3,0
sw2563A-ms98-a,43,A,276.265125,284.16625,7.901125,so they just turned to whatever be it drugs or be it crime or some way to make the money to get away from the situation they're in,2,0

sw2564A-ms98-a,23,A,113.661,126.805,13.144,they've got it set up where all current employees uh will be called on a random basis but uh you know it's very likely that some may be called more uh more than others,2,0
sw2564A-ms98-a,30,A,172.905125,186.352625,13.4475,but i still want people in th- in the office uh to have a professional demeanor about them_1 and uh and not be under the influe- influence when they come in to work and you know i guess if they ,1,0

sw2579A-ms98-a,46,A,185.255625,193.675875,8.42025,yeah oh boy the the that whew that would be tear disastrous if you had that rain storm and freezing weather,1,0
sw2579A-ms98-a,89,A,420.621375,423.155875,2.5345,yeah i guess it would be ,1,0
sw2579A-ms98-a,108,A,496.097,498.4795,2.3825,oh that must be nice,1,0
sw2579A-ms98-a,114,A,521.368875,526.833,5.464125,no well now you know it sounds like you ought to be in a condo down in Miami Beach somewhere,1,0
sw2579A-ms98-a,127,A,580.97375,588.512375,7.538625,well that's that's why i was suggesting uh that Saint Petersburg is got got to be the finest weather in the world,1,0
sw2579B-ms98-a,38,B,165.02675,173.567625,8.540875,well they are predicting rain and thunderstorms and i wouldn't be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had,2,0
sw2579B-ms98-a,49,B,225.63175,236.691875,11.060125,and i had gotten home shortly before that uh the rain started so uh i felt a little more secure that i was at home rather than having to be out driving in it,1,0
sw2579B-ms98-a,64,B,304.029375,310.850875,6.8215,but of course you're supposed to be the sun belt and i do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion,1,0
sw2579B-ms98-a,122,B,578.049125,583.74875,5.699625,course there too you never know what the weather's going to be when you start getting over to,1,0
sw2580B-ms98-a,41,B,177.571375,189.505625,11.93425,and national elections should be more than one day i mean i don't see how you can have tens of or hundreds of thousands of people that you know just can't quite make it on that particular day for one reason or another you know,1,0
sw2580B-ms98-a,42,B,189.505625,193.560625,4.055,two days to me doesn't seem to be too unrealistic for a national election,1,0
sw2580B-ms98-a,61,B,293.89,302.076875,8.186875,but i think in national elections uh again it should be the time is definitely against the people i think you ought to have two days you're voting for president,1,0
sw2580B-ms98-a,63,B,305.76825,317.151625,11.383375,and uh why couldn't it be Friday and Saturday i don't know what the ideal day is if you're trying to catch a weekend or maybe just Tuesday and Wednesday i'll bet you'd get a lot more people i think the news media has really they jump in there,1,0
sw2580B-ms98-a,65,B,325.415,330.149875,4.734875,and i think they jump in way way too early i think that ought to be restricted somehow,1,0
sw2580B-ms98-a,67,B,339.731125,348.617875,8.88675,uh i- i thought the polls had to be closed before you were allowed why would you release it to the newsmen first i- i don't even know how the news media get these numbers,1,0
sw2580B-ms98-a,68,B,348.617875,354.186375,5.5685,from the polls i would think that ought to be sacred and and until it's all over,1,0
sw2580B-ms98-a,100,B,518.91875,529.534375,10.615625,so if there's no controversy if you're not worried about who's going to win if you see you think it's going to be a shoo-in then uh you know you don't vote so uh ,1,0
sw2580B-ms98-a,113,B,587.396125,591.972875,4.57675,and maybe maybe absent maybe you ought to be able to do it on your telephone you know i mean i don't know,1,0

sw2582B-ms98-a,60,B,163.92075,170.550125,6.629375,but i just kind of a verbal agreement yeah i'm going stay here for a year and i'll be nice to you  if you'll be nice to me ,2,0
sw2582B-ms98-a,66,B,182.038375,186.417,4.378625,well what would you suggest think it would be a good idea even if i think i might be moving to buy a house ,2,0

sw2583A-ms98-a,1,A,0,4.7275,4.7275,the uh public school sys- system seems to be,1,0
sw2583A-ms98-a,4,A,24.72875,38.628875,13.900125,uh things a lot faster uh whether or not they actually have it learned th- that that yet uh remains to be seen at least in our kids case it's they're still in it but uh i know they're learning things that uh,1,0
sw2583A-ms98-a,8,A,61.239625,72.26425,11.024625,you know all the uh yeah it is but it's interesting that that there's that much more knowledge to be learned at this at this uh age you know not just the colors and begin on the alphabet it's ,1,0
sw2583A-ms98-a,21,A,168.674375,176.048625,7.37425,be rowdy at any one given time so they they put them outside a lot they try you know to get a lot of good breaks here and there and,1,0
sw2583A-ms98-a,31,A,260.7535,274.095375,13.341875,and he gets out at two forty five and that gives me a little bit of time to get parked and then i wait for be- between kids rather than drive all the way home i wait a little while and and at two thirty i mean at three thirty my daughter gets out,1,0
sw2583A-ms98-a,55,A,498.854875,510.12375,11.268875,and there seems to be a a large degree of violence not necessarily taught but but ingrained in a majority of the kids either from TV or from,1,0
sw2583A-ms98-a,58,A,523.598875,531.888,8.289125,it seems to be socially acceptable as a self-esteem you know building building the person's confidence up and you have,1,0
sw2583B-ms98-a,24,B,220.512875,223.534625,3.02175,that can be a disadvantage to the kids,1,0
sw2584A-ms98-a,49,A,250.5085,261.735625,11.227125,stuff so we didn't go camping that would be fun though to go that's one thing my husband wanted to do wa- on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went,1,0
sw2584A-ms98-a,51,A,266.882,276.88375,10.00175,it does and and ever once you know on my summer vacation you know my week long vacation i want to be a little bit pampered you know by a  or ,1,0
sw2584A-ms98-a,56,A,298.35525,303.130625,4.775375,yeah i think that'll be fun so we're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend go there and,1,0
sw2584A-ms98-a,80,A,380.65425,391.522,10.86775, you have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff to really be camping  yeah well do you you ha- say you haven't been in years,1,0
sw2584B-ms98-a,19,B,80.7785,87.230625,6.452125,oh the kids love they they just love it it's wonderful for them to be outside,1,0
sw2584B-ms98-a,38,B,195.977125,206.453,10.475875,i've only lived here about six years so i- i- if i have one it must be very very slight but  the Yankees can hear it,1,0
sw2584B-ms98-a,93,B,505.685875,510.048125,4.36225,well excuse me just second  honey i'll be wi- yeah go ahead ,1,0
sw2585A-ms98-a,7,A,39.030125,52.572875,13.54275,you know to escape the genocide programs that are over there and seen you know heard about some of the problems that they've had and i'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be because i,1,0
sw2585A-ms98-a,15,A,87.54275,94.296375,6.753625,yeah sure well Texas used to be part of Mexico or most of it ,1,0
sw2585A-ms98-a,20,A,106.869875,115.32025,8.450375,well i guess the one thing i do see that is is that needs to be a solution is that if you do let people into the country i do feel you have a certain obligation,1,0
sw2585A-ms98-a,26,A,168.546,183.419125,14.873125,and they're they're incredible victims of crime and part of it is this lack of lack of basic information being dissimilated and i'm not saying it's easy to do and i know there are a few people who are trying but but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on,1,0
sw2585A-ms98-a,44,A,315.577125,321.427625,5.8505,you know by explaining to people how the language and what the problems learning English might be and such,1,0
sw2585A-ms98-a,69,A,405.39,419.38575,13.99575,yeah it would be a good experience and you'd be helping people i'm sure very much and and i- i mean not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the Asian groups are having a lot of trouble i mean and part of the problem is that,2,0
sw2585A-ms98-a,72,A,435.72075,445.42,9.69925,are n- not having the same success i think some people have just assumed well why why can't you be successful the Japanese were or the Chinese were or something And it's really much more complicated,1,0
sw2585A-ms98-a,83,A,468.2455,480.371625,12.126125,oh yeah i- i think it's a wonderful thing to do and there's a lot there's a lot more i guess another possible solution is since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it,1,0
sw2585A-ms98-a,85,A,484.20675,486.9055,2.69875,would be would might be really useful,2,0
sw2585B-ms98-a,48,B,392.876125,401.9205,9.044375,into the system i thought that would be good experience for me and i've applied at another district where many of the children are Asian,1,0
sw2585B-ms98-a,50,B,403.694375,406.196375,2.502,and i think that would be wonderful too,1,0
sw2586A-ms98-a,106,A,413.893,416.766375,2.873375,yeah you guys sure want to be out of range,1,0
sw2586B-ms98-a,64,B,222.48275,226.63725,4.1545,oh it's just that that just happens to be what the fish like this year huh,1,0
sw2586B-ms98-a,91,B,336.46575,340.17175,3.706,oh  goodness it must be a little bit cold,1,0
sw2586B-ms98-a,127,B,490.63275,494.076125,3.443375,so that would be neat to try it some time,1,0
sw2587B-ms98-a,29,B,124.554375,134.700875,10.1465,yes uh-huh that uh l- lots of new uh newsmen were created during that so it will be interesting to see what happens,1,0
sw2587B-ms98-a,57,B,222.005625,224.640375,2.63475,it'll be interesting to see what happens,1,0
sw2588B-ms98-a,116,B,495.86225,509.747625,13.885375,that's her favorite too  yeah you know it's funny with Chinese restaurants since you can't read the menu or anything you tend to stick with one thing i used to it used to always be sweet and sour pork for me and then i just i i started getting a little more health conscious,1,0
sw2589A-ms98-a,22,A,113.615125,123.07075,9.455625,that's true the only i think the only thing that they would argue about that is that you know every child needs to learn every subject i mean that's that might be the only thing,1,0
sw2589A-ms98-a,89,A,484.78225,490.286875,5.504625,because they're going to be good and try and earn those things,1,0
sw2589A-ms98-a,90,A,490.286875,503.611875,13.325,you know to get the positive part of it i mean they'd ra- much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked so they're definitely going to work towards being good you know rather than trying to act up and be bad,2,0
sw2589A-ms98-a,94,A,521.159625,530.07325,8.913625,well that's true  i think i think really though i mean that's one thing that i mean my kids definitely get spanked when they need they need to be ,1,0
sw2589A-ms98-a,97,A,543.706,546.86475,3.15875,i don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked ,1,0
sw2589A-ms98-a,100,A,560.7125,570.595,9.8825,but i don't think i mean some kids don't get don't get spanked at home and some kids need to be spanked at  i mean don't you ,1,0
sw2589A-ms98-a,104,A,578.02225,592.43275,14.4105,right right well there's so many parents that say you can deal with a child without spanking them which is true you can but there are times when a child needs to be spanked i mean they do things that they need that,1,0
sw2589B-ms98-a,11,B,63.198875,67.065875,3.867,the educators need to be a little bit more,1,0
sw2589B-ms98-a,20,B,87.133125,93.53,6.396875,out of each child some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff other kids are going to be,2,0
sw2589B-ms98-a,21,B,93.53,97.6055,4.0755,really into math some are really going to be heavy into reading,1,0
sw2589B-ms98-a,24,B,102.55775,106.812875,4.255125,i mean it's great to be well rounded and have be exposed to all this stuff,2,0
sw2589B-ms98-a,27,B,126.892625,131.500875,4.60825,they need exposure to every subject they don't need to be masters of it,1,0
sw2589B-ms98-a,41,B,219.974,228.238,8.264,they make all these people out to be oh they were great men and they're the father of the country and all this he had just as much dirt on him as anybody else if not more,1,0
sw2589B-ms98-a,51,B,384.35075,388.9575,4.60675,there has to be some sort of discipline and there has to be some sort of punishment,2,0
sw2591A-ms98-a,1,A,0,3.664125,3.664125,the uh whole savings and loan thing seems to be uh,1,0
sw2591A-ms98-a,5,A,36.679125,46.139,9.459875,so it just seems like a a really set up you know the whole thing was set up to to be abused and so human nature did so,1,0
sw2591A-ms98-a,8,A,137.965,151.776625,13.811625,just because of the sheer numbers that were here as of you know the and the chances of getting a bad one would be greater just out of the sheer population of them being here and the whole problem seemed to start start toward uh,1,0
sw2591A-ms98-a,33,A,381.664125,385.618125,3.954,yeah yeah i don't think there's going to be that many more of them_1 i- i would,1,0
sw2591A-ms98-a,37,A,407.60375,418.613125,11.009375,well it's hard to say how many more bad bad systems or bad apples there are out in the system but i would i'd be willing to bet that uh it shouldn't be more than a couple more years tha- that,2,0
sw2591A-ms98-a,40,A,421.424,427.89425,6.47025,as far as as far as not having this getting over this peak as it is now uh there's still going to be an unusual,1,0
sw2591A-ms98-a,42,A,437.276625,445.688125,8.4115,but if you want to just say we're over the hump and we're starting to get better i think in a couple of years it'll be quite obvious that we're over the hump and getting better,1,0
sw2591B-ms98-a,9,B,74.593875,81.965875,7.372,via whatever medium whether it be savings and loans or banks either one was the order of the day  so needless to say they did,1,0
sw2591B-ms98-a,24,B,176.011625,187.221,11.209375,oh i'm glad to hear that because_1 i've been concerned that the banks may be going the same direction that the savings and loans primarily because uh what got the savings and loans in trouble is the same sort of things that's beginning to get the banks in trouble,1,0
sw2591B-ms98-a,26,B,195.299125,207.941,12.641875,uh who were trying to build a lot of uh uh rental business space and uh mall type space and things like that and uh it looked like in the seventies that that was going to be a real booming thing uh a infinitum i guess,1,0
sw2591B-ms98-a,75,B,471.99375,480.46775,8.474,i mean is inflation going to make some of it go away and the rest of it we're going to pick up the tab as taxpayers or are we going to be able to sell some of these bad loans or pick them up somehow or another,1,0
sw2592A-ms98-a,109,A,538.14575,545.69875,7.553,and it was really important for me to be able to be out in time to swing by the school and pick my son up,2,0
sw2592B-ms98-a,38,B,368.119125,382.279375,14.16025,uh the kids away from the mothers for a litt- a little bit and it's even to the point where the host family at the meetings at each other's homes have to pro- uh uh have to provide refreshments and they've got to be cooked by you and you can't say mom make some cookies for us,1,0
sw2593B-ms98-a,18,B,128.526375,141.307,12.780625,especially like needlepoint needlepoint cushions and things but it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it you know that and that the petty point and things like that it's like God it j- just seems like it's,1,0
sw2593B-ms98-a,26,B,173.321375,186.050875,12.7295,but and i- i mean i'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that because i can remember when i used to do you know those little salt dough figurines and things it was it was relaxing you know creative you felt very creative,1,0
sw2594A-ms98-a,23,A,75.002625,84.74875,9.746125,uh yeah all plastic they ha- all plastic has to go into a recycling bin all cans have to be recycled all newspapers have to be recycled,2,0
sw2594A-ms98-a,30,A,127.303125,130.865875,3.56275,where some aspects will be mandatory um-hum,1,0
sw2594A-ms98-a,42,A,172.3845,182.608875,10.224375,started doing it it was it's one of those things you know and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be separated you know that's,1,0
sw2594A-ms98-a,79,A,300.2795,302.575125,2.295625,right yeah that would probably be true,1,0
sw2594A-ms98-a,100,A,385.6255,393.436375,7.810875,and then they're saying w- we estimate this landfill will be ov- will be full in two years unless we cut back,2,0
sw2594A-ms98-a,112,A,449.7035,456.651125,6.947625,the {deinking} process that they have to they use to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused,1,0
sw2594A-ms98-a,116,A,473.53425,486.31525,12.781,so but others you know like tin cans and plastics are are really uh efficient you know they uh they m- they melt on quickly and can be you know just because of the heating and things yeah and glass yeah,1,0
sw2594B-ms98-a,25,B,126.216,128.613,2.397,will it be mandatory,1,0
sw2594B-ms98-a,111,B,508.19,512.15,3.96,um i don't know how cost efficient that would be i guess,1,0
sw2595A-ms98-a,53,A,221.971875,229.505,7.533125,the fuel and air and compression and all that stuff that needs to be precise and it's controlled by computer i figure i won't mess with that ,1,0
sw2595A-ms98-a,77,A,343.167125,356.436875,13.26975,they had a big big bumper they got on there big white bumper that covers like the whole bottom front of the car that that whole thing you know to be replaced and repainted would cost five hundred dollars,1,0
sw2595B-ms98-a,27,B,89.253,95.50325,6.25025,right right not the right the things i know how to do i i'm not an expert i don't claim to be,1,0
sw2595B-ms98-a,33,B,120.409625,122.767125,2.3575,and then i'd be in big trouble,1,0
sw2595B-ms98-a,49,B,177.691375,183.5695,5.878125,oh it'll be this much money and i'll say oh well i'm going to think about that that sounds like too much ,1,0
sw2595B-ms98-a,141,B,532.066125,536.7905,4.724375,and the part could be probably fixed you know for a third of the price of of a new one,1,0
sw2595B-ms98-a,161,B,587.54175,590.377125,2.835375,right right but it it's going to be a while i think but,1,0
sw2596A-ms98-a,59,A,220.49525,229.461875,8.966625,i haven't seen uh either one of them_1 yet uh the second one is showing right now i guess in the theaters and uh the first one's going to be on cable next month i believe,1,0
sw2596A-ms98-a,97,A,360.75675,375.495,14.73825,and the the women thought that they should be able to sue the guys for being a lousy date  they had various reasons for it but uh the the topics uh it it's entertaining for uh for the the audience there,1,0
sw2596A-ms98-a,113,A,434.780375,440.488875,5.7085,so the NBA basketball play-offs will be coming up real soon within the next uh two weeks,1,0
sw2596A-ms98-a,126,A,491.4885,494.488625,3.000125,should be taping more movies right now,1,0
sw2596A-ms98-a,127,A,494.488625,503.993875,9.50525,i think next month uh cable's going to have a couple more uh good movies on i think The Hunt For Red October is on next month on HBO i haven't seen that one yet and that's supposed to be very good,1,0
sw2596B-ms98-a,144,B,453.280375,462.49825,9.217875,oh that i don't i don't really get into watching sports on TV i'd rather be there in person i guess but if you can't be there in person i guess seeing it on TV is the next best thing,2,0
sw2597B-ms98-a,68,B,394.526875,407.4455,12.918625,i don't know they it Schwartz- Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it to you know the uh the go ahead to do it,1,0
sw2598A-ms98-a,23,A,110.916375,122.7735,11.857125,that was good um oh it was great and it you you you think you know for a Stephen you know it because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory but there's only one well there's a couple scenes,1,0
sw2599A-ms98-a,13,A,76.98325,81.7275,4.74425,and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year,1,0
sw2599A-ms98-a,15,A,91.04675,96.511,5.46425,uh these guys are right maybe they will come through and and do something this year i look for it to be a pretty good year,1,0
sw2599A-ms98-a,18,A,106.544375,120.87225,14.327875,some of them turned out to be pretty good players uh some of them didn't and you know maybe the stuff that uh Jerry Jones is talking about the uh the reconstruction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off at least we hope it will,2,0
sw2599A-ms98-a,33,A,230.238,241.75925,11.52125,or uh if  if something happens that that adrenaline really starts flowing they say hey we got to do something now and and start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few  few minutes,1,0
sw2599B-ms98-a,45,B,286.2845,292.429625,6.145125,yeah i'm sure you know i mean my sentimental favorite would have to be Philadelphia but i i sure am scared of them Giants,1,0
sw2600A-ms98-a,32,A,99.586625,107.197375,7.61075,uh which has to be their doctor but they're not doing anything to me other than testing me so i let them do that,1,0
sw2600A-ms98-a,131,A,535.024375,536.930125,1.90575,yeah there should be,1,0
sw2600B-ms98-a,90,B,305.888125,309.455125,3.567,because without it you can be,1,0
sw2602A-ms98-a,7,A,31.65325,38.73575,7.0825,i guess i don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be but i think just the instability of the country right now uh-huh,1,0
sw2602B-ms98-a,15,B,56.28175,64.80075,8.519,naturally we were at the time the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat so we got lots quite a bit of,1,0
sw2602B-ms98-a,65,B,254.478,262.986,8.508,there's probably five or six which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs that are in positions over some of these Soviet states,1,0
sw2602B-ms98-a,68,B,267.490875,270.41,2.919125,it is it's going to be a total blood bath,1,0
sw2602B-ms98-a,78,B,296.72425,303.1955,6.47125,you put five Soviet Hyundee helicopters in the air they can level the entire area and there won't be anything left alive,1,0
sw2602B-ms98-a,85,B,323.613875,328.4515,4.837625,but on a highly populated area like some of the Soviet cities would be,1,0
sw2602B-ms98-a,124,B,521.95125,526.124875,4.173625,so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils at this point,1,0
sw2602B-ms98-a,132,B,558.6565,560.826125,2.169625,it may be,1,0
sw2602B-ms98-a,138,B,578.351625,582.582375,4.23075,United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is,1,0
sw2602B-ms98-a,139,B,582.582375,590.25725,7.674875,not only does it it can talk the talk but it's got to be able to walk the walk it's got to have the stuff to back it back up what it's saying,1,0
sw2603A-ms98-a,83,A,342.364125,348.389125,6.025,then that would yeah i guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you wouldn't it,1,0
sw2603A-ms98-a,112,A,460.642,463.92975,3.28775,yeah that would be really ,1,0
sw2603B-ms98-a,15,B,126.506625,129.76475,3.258125,i like to be able to sweat have my hair a mess,1,0
sw2603B-ms98-a,17,B,131.23025,136.762875,5.532625,feel that okay fine if my bathing suit slips a little bit i don't have to be conscious of,1,0
sw2603B-ms98-a,18,B,136.762875,146.063875,9.301,of it being a little bit too low and i my bathing suit's just one piece so there's no big deal all the way around but i don't have to be conscious of what i'm doing or how i'm doing it,1,0
sw2603B-ms98-a,46,B,289.001125,292.31975,3.318625,and i'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock,1,0
sw2603B-ms98-a,105,B,539.93125,546.699375,6.768125,is you just sit like you said you can sit and do it and watch the TV and not even really be conscious of what you are doing,1,0
sw2604A-ms98-a,8,A,20.99625,28.138375,7.142125,uh i mean the first thing is the oh if it's going to be mandatory it's got to be mandatory i mean everybody not just like you know poor people and all that you know but,2,0
sw2604A-ms98-a,10,A,32.942,41.130375,8.188375,i don't know it'd probably be it'd probably be good i just don't know if you know if i was eighteen or whatever i'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever ,3,0
sw2604A-ms98-a,52,A,261.559125,264.1745,2.615375,oh uh that would be a nightmare,1,0
sw2604A-ms98-a,78,A,375.383375,386.518125,11.13475,yeah well uh it was it was interesting because that's an interesting question you know should these people be allowed to or not i think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed ,1,0
sw2604B-ms98-a,13,B,81.00425,89.887625,8.883375,be it cleaning out uh lots in in their neighborhood or whatever kind of community or public service might be available,2,0
sw2604B-ms98-a,19,B,141.0135,150.824,9.8105,i could see a a full a run a gamut of different kinds of opportunities things that need to be done that wou- that could be done in an hour or two,2,0
sw2604B-ms98-a,22,B,162.581375,171.59775,9.016375,uh bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time oh you're going to go to this camp and you're going to you know like um,1,0
sw2604B-ms98-a,30,B,224.18625,234.005375,9.819125,and i i see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where or or at least the area where the person lives it may not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county,1,0
sw2604B-ms98-a,31,B,234.005375,244.704,10.698625,because then you're you're coming in contact with it it's not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there that i'll never be able to see again unless i happen to go on vacation up there,1,0
sw2604B-ms98-a,32,B,244.704,247.936375,3.232375,it's so it almost needs to be something that has more,1,0
sw2604B-ms98-a,42,B,289.4485,296.175875,6.727375,but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in and would take a turn in,1,0
sw2604B-ms98-a,49,B,323.708375,337.757875,14.0495,tha- that would be a part of selling it to the community to the adults ahead of them that probably would never serve and and to each succeeding generation there'd definitely have to be a major PR campaign in each community each county,2,0
sw2604B-ms98-a,77,B,513.70425,521.995,8.29075,it makes me feel better it it makes me feel like well there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth,1,0
sw2604B-ms98-a,85,B,561.986125,570.222125,8.236,uh or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say oh my goodness now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology,1,0
sw2605A-ms98-a,63,A,278.275,284.76325,6.48825,then then all you'll have will be road camping trips you know let's just go out to the mountains with the car honey and uh ,1,0
sw2605B-ms98-a,27,B,98.255125,106.483125,8.228,now i got hit by the same thing because we thought we were going to be real mountain men and uh we got up there and we had the little pills you're supposed to put in the water and make sure that it's potable,1,0
sw2605B-ms98-a,28,B,106.483125,117.017625,10.5345,and of course we're up you know up above you know fourteen thousand feet or whatever and we said we- well how dirty could the water be right you nev- never think about bacteria or amoeba or anything like that,1,0
sw2605B-ms98-a,29,B,117.017625,123.141375,6.12375,you think well nobody's using the bathroom farther up stream so it's got to be all right so we were doing things like uh,1,0
sw2605B-ms98-a,39,B,167.7395,174.7875,7.048,that's that's right you don't want to be the first one up and have to put the fire on and have to ta- take care of everything while everyone else is sacked out,1,0
sw2605B-ms98-a,69,B,336.77325,346.2095,9.43625,and uh you've really got to be careful who you go out there with and that they're out they're out for what they're doing and you're out for what you want to do and then you all get get to do what you want to do i guess while you're out there but uh,1,0
sw2606A-ms98-a,49,A,182.8,188.380875,5.580875,uh he he has to be an outstanding physical specimen to to do what he's done,1,0
sw2606A-ms98-a,54,A,220.199125,233.27675,13.077625,that uh that pitched a bunch of innings last year as a nineteen or twenty year o- year old and they were using what happened to Valenzuela as an example that they should be careful and not over work him this early of course i was really uh,1,0
sw2606A-ms98-a,67,A,320.719375,329.287625,8.56825,and uh you you know they are O and four but i think they're going to be one and four at the end of today they're sitting here with two out in the ninth with a uh fifteen to three lead,1,0
sw2606A-ms98-a,82,A,409.404125,420.756125,11.352,uh my job takes me out of the country a lot and it always seems to be during the summer uh last year we got to go out maybe about a dozen times which is the most we've ever gone out and we had about uh the Rangers,1,0
sw2606A-ms98-a,85,A,444.1635,453.0685,8.905,what we like to do the uh the stands have got three tiers to them and we like to be in the third tier behind home plate about the second row,1,0
sw2606A-ms98-a,86,A,453.0685,463.127625,10.059125,and uh the the park holds about forty thousand people and uh i never go on a night when they think there's going to be forty thousand there's just too big crowds i i pick the games where they don't,1,0
sw2606B-ms98-a,180,B,571.79275,578.083875,6.291125,there's actually there may be an AM station that does it i'm not there may be an AM station that does it but i'm not i'm not really sure,2,0
sw2606B-ms98-a,182,B,580.385875,587.813375,7.4275,yeah but it's i mean you could you the game could be at seven thirty at seven fifteen and you could say hey let's go to the  and you'll get a seat,1,0
sw2608A-ms98-a,32,A,134.23575,139.56875,5.333,uh-huh y- uh when you core it you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off,1,0
sw2608A-ms98-a,108,A,449.386,462.92725,13.54125,but you do have to have it you know you do have to have it hot when you cook it i mean your pan it does have to be really hot you know when you put it in but it's not like it's burned and it what it what blackens it is the seasoning,1,0
sw2609A-ms98-a,9,A,53.5345,64.400625,10.866125,i mean i i assume that those who don't vote i mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote they tend to be you know poor blacks for example vote very little and things like that and i assume that they would vote differently,1,0
sw2609A-ms98-a,66,A,363.789625,370.93175,7.142125,i don't know i kind of part of me is wary and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty,1,0
sw2609A-ms98-a,77,A,416.0105,422.815625,6.805125,driving denies you a drivers license people get very upset but actually it's a privilege which is allowed to be revoked,1,0
sw2609A-ms98-a,86,A,473.11775,483.03,9.91225,not in the sense of the Republican party now versus a democratic uh government and arguing successfully why the United States should be a republic not a democracy,1,0
sw2609A-ms98-a,90,A,499.00025,510.742875,11.742625,presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person and and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy,1,0
sw2609A-ms98-a,93,A,530.05175,537.820625,7.768875,um they can change the law in a democ- a fully democratic process and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case um,1,0
sw2609A-ms98-a,94,A,537.820625,551.42475,13.604125, oh you know a candi- if there's some minority that people don't like because of you know racial hatred or something like that the majority can just simply vote again vote against them and cases like that he argues need to be constrained and and actually i agree,1,0
sw2609A-ms98-a,102,A,569.743,576.231875,6.488875,yeah well their job is to be reelected by in large and so they work on that job,1,0
sw2609A-ms98-a,104,A,588.58575,599.662,11.07625,if someone isn't as much as a government person they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange because i mean if i'm hiring a plumber i want a real plumber i want someone trained in in it i'm very like,1,0
sw2609B-ms98-a,63,B,373.76675,385.5575,11.79075,perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age required to register and vote for four years and perhaps,1,0
sw2609B-ms98-a,64,B,385.5575,389.048375,3.490875,they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty,1,0
sw2609B-ms98-a,73,B,425.16075,428.279,3.11825,maybe it should maybe it should be,1,0
sw2609B-ms98-a,79,B,438.670125,447.220875,8.55075,don't have a great i  i think i checked that as a question i'd be willing to discuss ,1,0
sw2610A-ms98-a,84,A,370.243375,375.626125,5.38275,it it can be annoying and my other con- concern is,1,0

sw2611B-ms98-a,38,B,218.882625,223.717875,4.83525,and he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them,1,0
sw2611B-ms98-a,63,B,362.51,367.69575,5.18575,um that's something that i'd be very interested in very interested in learning,1,0
sw2612A-ms98-a,36,A,148.513,154.57325,6.06025,yeah i i would be interested to see if Sam Nunn decides to go this time i i,1,0
sw2612A-ms98-a,41,A,175.0105,178.575,3.5645,the last time around   going to be very exciting,1,0
sw2612A-ms98-a,61,A,258.746875,263.3315,4.584625,and i think Bush has turned out to be a lot better President than people gave him credit for,1,0
sw2612A-ms98-a,66,A,273.520625,282.891875,9.37125,yeah a- and i i wonder th- you know if if that's i mean tha- that real- that really should be all we need in a president someone who is capable of managing,1,0
sw2612A-ms98-a,130,A,524.165875,532.574875,8.409,yeah a- i mean certainly he wasn't going to take Bob Dole on and not that Bob Dole would even take the position i mean he'd be giving up more than he'd gain,1,0
sw2612B-ms98-a,11,B,37.7765,48.5235,10.747,yeah that's true there there's a lot of talk over there tha- i don't think anyone imagined that it could possibly be as as successful and and painless as it had been,1,0
sw2612B-ms98-a,34,B,163.997375,170.22425,6.226875,that that would be interesting i i must admit i haven't been really enthusiastic about the Democratic entrants,1,0
sw2612B-ms98-a,90,B,459.917375,466.292125,6.37475,i i i don't know if he's the the right one to replace him he'd probably be a perfectly  replacement but,1,0
sw2613A-ms98-a,26,A,108.26275,113.52725,5.2645,no i don't know they're they keep doing things and it doesn't seem to be doing any good,1,0
sw2613A-ms98-a,102,A,459.98225,467.031125,7.048875,and i said well i'm not too awfully concerned about that if it's going to start melting the ice cap it's not going to be for a long time yet,1,0
sw2613A-ms98-a,110,A,504.057125,509.714625,5.6575,of course it it might be just a couple of scientists trying to get their name in the paper sort of like cold fusion ,1,0
sw2613B-ms98-a,24,B,103.665,108.8815,5.2165,well i'm not sure that we're going to be able to uh solve much of the problem,1,0
sw2613B-ms98-a,120,B,585.02125,596.786375,11.765125,and uh one of the women that was leading the group said well they say they're going to pump uh oil through there but before long they'll be pumping radioactivity through it,1,0
sw2614A-ms98-a,44,A,317.1595,332.005625,14.846125,uh and i think the governments are working on that to try to have some uh businesses uh at the borders of both sides so that you can you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here and to to get the jobs you know there there may be some organized way to do this,1,0
sw2614A-ms98-a,45,A,332.005625,344.8205,12.814875,i i do feel for them uh they are very envious of us or they wouldn't be coming up here you know risking a lot not that they're risking their lives of course but risking a lot uh getting thrown back i guess is all that uh happens,1,0
sw2614A-ms98-a,53,A,379.004875,391.4985,12.493625,i think a a common factor to a lot of problems both whether it be crime if if you want to jump on that is mostly uh poverty uh and i think a lot of their problems is poverty if we could,1,0
sw2614A-ms98-a,56,A,419.140625,434.103125,14.9625,building a plant in Singapore uh they're in Taiwan and Japan and they're they haven't had what that much luck in South America and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything,1,0
sw2614A-ms98-a,57,A,434.103125,449.09225,14.989125,there's got to be trade i guess that's some of the answer i guess is business uh uh and i try to be an optimist and say well that that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to is to get some business going between each other ,3,0
sw2614A-ms98-a,59,A,455.10375,466.68025,11.5765,they've got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of of well potential that way a lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that but uh there's got to be a lot of potential down there,1,0
sw2614A-ms98-a,71,A,514.214375,524.039,9.824625,there's going to be i guess thousands i don't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings and i wonder how they're going to analyze them whether it would be,2,0
sw2614A-ms98-a,72,A,524.039,529.888625,5.849625,listening to them or analyzing i g- they've got to be analyzing with a a voice recorder some how,1,0
sw2614A-ms98-a,82,A,576.926375,589.712125,12.78575,go ahead you you comment on it yeah i'm glad that you're in the business that i know TI's gotten it with their Speak and Spell and everything i've told my wife that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer you wouldn't have to have a keyboard ,1,0
sw2614A-ms98-a,83,A,589.712125,598.682,8.969875,you'll be able to just give it commands and i'm sure they have some of that now and not not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people,1,0
sw2614B-ms98-a,17,B,85.021625,93.66925,8.647625,some people they say Peru can't be traveled to and the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth,1,0
sw2614B-ms98-a,23,B,172.487875,183.336875,10.849,would be true i mean certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking in in his wildest dreams from his neighbors,1,0
sw2614B-ms98-a,33,B,261.43175,267.957125,6.525375,yeah well it's it's so interesting i ju- i just don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics,1,0
sw2615A-ms98-a,51,A,259.910625,274.907125,14.9965,if you treat them right they're not the gas guzzlers i think that they've got the reputation to be i'm convinced that uh Detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes,1,0
sw2615A-ms98-a,57,A,317.2575,322.774625,5.517125,i think those g- those little V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it but,1,0
sw2615A-ms98-a,71,A,404.898125,413.001625,8.1035,and he had never really thought about it And he says well hopefully i won't have to change them before i trade it off Yeah it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall,1,0
sw2615A-ms98-a,86,A,477.269,490.470125,13.201125,i haven't had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be uh better than having i've got an an Olds Tornado that i think's got six belts on the sucker And i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump and uh,1,0
sw2616A-ms98-a,86,A,503.4285,507.28325,3.85475,they're just some things that might not be worth it,1,0
sw2617A-ms98-a,22,A,148.6645,153.812375,5.147875,and i have a feeling that the Persian Gulf crisis is going to be the same way,1,0
sw2617B-ms98-a,7,B,46.424125,51.76725,5.343125,you know i just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman and i'm not sure that's our role,1,0
sw2617B-ms98-a,15,B,115.82325,125.667,9.84375,turning around Just now you know trying to be rectified and i'm and i'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally on so many of the people,1,0
sw2617B-ms98-a,23,B,165.994125,179.757,13.762875,and then he has backed out he has pulled out and i realize they're still saying well here you're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein so why aren't you helping us and you see i think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation,1,0
sw2617B-ms98-a,67,B,379.2475,387.234125,7.986625,i just remember oh yeah our guys are over there and it's sad and we shouldn't be fighting a war but there was no let's support them you know,1,0
sw2618A-ms98-a,80,A,438.149625,439.971,1.821375,and no reason to be,1,0
sw2618A-ms98-a,95,A,488.248,491.236,2.988,well that wouldn't even be a very far drive,1,0
sw2618B-ms98-a,1,B,0,4.111875,4.111875,w-  this is going to be very bo- boring because i don't ,1,0
sw2618B-ms98-a,15,B,49.241,53.755875,4.514875,uh that would have to be mine i hate exercising it's so boring,1,0
sw2618B-ms98-a,34,B,125.563625,132.965125,7.4015,uh uh i would have no doubt what so ever that any one of them could be dropped in the middle of no where and they'd uh they'd ex- ,1,0
sw2618B-ms98-a,65,B,328.386875,332.190875,3.804,oh yes yes yell they used to be but now they're trying to really,1,0
sw2618B-ms98-a,104,B,508.35875,515.018375,6.659625,well the next time you go across the state line or when you come back in be sure and stop at one of the Texas,1,0
sw2618B-ms98-a,127,B,573.2625,578.91975,5.65725,but be sure and stop at one of those Texas bur- tourist bureaus and get their literature,1,0
sw2619A-ms98-a,14,A,47.014,55.49175,8.47775,the secret seeming to me is to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and pounds to kilom-,1,0
sw2619A-ms98-a,19,A,89.7435,102.528375,12.784875,and i think the real problem with this this weird conversion you see signs that say fifty five miles per hour and you know whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour you know people you know it's hard to take it seriously,1,0
sw2619A-ms98-a,20,A,102.528375,112.468125,9.93975,and as long as both were given you basically just don't read the kilometers per hour you just say well look read the miles per hour one the other one must be for someone else,1,0
sw2619A-ms98-a,44,A,265.218875,277.367375,12.1485, and they but you know that must have taken uh that was something that had to be done quickly you know because of external circumstances but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe or the rest of continental Europe and,1,0
sw2619B-ms98-a,30,B,230.04725,235.753125,5.705875,no i- i think that would be the easiest way but human nature being such as it is,1,0
sw2619B-ms98-a,35,B,256.7305,260.224625,3.494125,well that's true it it has to be kind of a discreet transaction,1,0
sw2620A-ms98-a,41,A,212.05375,222.346625,10.292875,okay uh we have not camped a great deal here because uh a good share of the time in the Summer time it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping,1,0
sw2620B-ms98-a,35,B,167.1755,174.04475,6.86925,and we early in life we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very very expensive,1,0
sw2620B-ms98-a,46,B,221.942375,229.2575,7.315125,well it just depends on where you go for instance if you went down to the sea shore it would be wonderful a nice breeze blowing in from the water,1,0
sw2621A-ms98-a,3,A,5.493875,12.788625,7.29475,can i guess your favorite team if you had one might be the Steelers well i can understand that i you know i kind of like the Cowboys too,1,0
sw2621A-ms98-a,10,A,47.714875,58.79375,11.078875,i don't know he'd be good at it he's such a motivator he he primarily you know with the quarterbacks that would be his specialty i wished i wished they could work something i really like him i really do,2,0
sw2621A-ms98-a,12,A,60.484875,65.4885,5.003625,yeah okay i'd love to see Dallas and Houston play in a Super Bowl that would be really great,1,0
sw2621A-ms98-a,28,A,117.498625,122.49375,4.995125,well that's a tough it would be tough to do it really would they have such a super team for years,1,0
sw2621A-ms98-a,30,A,125.241875,129.499625,4.25775,four in a row i don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not,1,0
sw2621A-ms98-a,45,A,169.2755,180.96,11.6845,of the of course you never know the guys they pick you know m- may never play a game you jus- never know it's it's a gamble it really is they may get hurt or not be able to participate at that level if you know,1,0
sw2621A-ms98-a,60,A,240.488375,245.773125,5.28475,they always think they can win you know which is the way it should be and boy he never gave up i'll tell you,1,0
sw2621A-ms98-a,131,A,573.752,582.32975,8.57775,you know arrest record won't let able won't let them play anywhere else they seem to go to   to go to the Raiders but that just may be you know perceived,1,0
sw2621B-ms98-a,93,B,314.741625,319.315125,4.5735,an they have to be in ideal physical shape basically,1,0
sw2622A-ms98-a,11,A,38.62575,43.0395,4.41375,yeah i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits,1,0
sw2622A-ms98-a,27,A,132.567625,140.815375,8.24775,and uh i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue,1,0
sw2622A-ms98-a,45,A,221.844375,224.632125,2.78775,within their private company they'd be in jail,1,0
sw2622B-ms98-a,12,B,42.682625,51.8705,9.187875,right i i think that i i mean i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place,1,0
sw2622B-ms98-a,14,B,55.549375,57.74225,2.192875,i think if it were to be uh,1,0
sw2622B-ms98-a,15,B,57.74225,59.42475,1.6825,if it were to be um,1,0
sw2622B-ms98-a,16,B,59.42475,63.00225,3.5775,if it were to be hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the door,1,0
sw2622B-ms98-a,18,B,65.88625,75.615875,9.729625,if if it were to be spent in the right way i think i wouldn't be so upset about it but given that it that it's not spent properly i think it's a major problem ,2,0
sw2622B-ms98-a,24,B,118.8465,123.7145,4.868,they just don't they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing,1,0
sw2622B-ms98-a,34,B,168.942,180.557,11.615,uh i'm i'm just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places i mean it'd be it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older,2,0
sw2622B-ms98-a,37,B,197.4745,201.048125,3.573625,you know should be getting it but instead i think it's going to the wrong places,1,0
sw2622B-ms98-a,45,B,228.175125,241.7755,13.600375,yeah i don't i don't well becau- because they're the ones who make the laws  so who's going to yell at them you know it'd be nice if we sort of as one band together and and uh and an performed a citizens arrest i guess,1,0
sw2622B-ms98-a,48,B,265.839875,275.29,9.450125,i agree i agree but um yeah like like you said i wonder you know if if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process and i wonder if it'll ever be a change process,2,0
sw2622B-ms98-a,50,B,280.23675,283.387,3.15025,you know all those things that really could be changed that,1,0
sw2623A-ms98-a,9,A,16.21925,19.28325,3.064,that's great i always thought it'd be great to have twins,1,0
sw2623A-ms98-a,75,A,293.219375,305.153,11.933625,our youngest is uh expecting her first baby so they're they're all out and on their own they're a and we have one to get married yet  and they'll all be married ,1,0
sw2623A-ms98-a,101,A,405.554375,412.244,6.689625,and i have mixed feelings about that she's able to do that and i don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home,1,0
sw2623A-ms98-a,102,A,412.244,425.773125,13.529125,but yet on the other hand  i i've got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children i'm kind of old fashioned i guess that way but they seem to they seem to give uh quality time ,1,0
sw2623A-ms98-a,119,A,484.77275,488.703125,3.930375,which your income would be a lot better now,1,0
sw2623B-ms98-a,56,B,351.7255,355.30075,3.57525,you know to learn how to be a a father and a parent,1,0
sw2623B-ms98-a,72,B,461.493,466.173375,4.680375,even if even if someone's home all the time there's still a lot of things that have to be done,1,0
sw2624A-ms98-a,17,A,99.107625,106.052625,6.945,and trying to raise several children and i could see across the border where the good life would be for my children,1,0
sw2624A-ms98-a,70,A,441.115375,455.631625,14.51625,is we can feed them today but they'll be hungry tomorrow what'll we do with them tomorrow do we feed them again tomorrow well how long how long can we continue to feed the world we can't do it are they starving to death yes and that's very sad,1,0
sw2624A-ms98-a,85,A,565.610625,571.564,5.953375,when you're talking about money you'd be surprised how human we all get very quickly,1,0
sw2624B-ms98-a,11,B,47.898625,57.97825,10.079625,so maybe my isolation isn't for our country  might be a little bit for the world i don't know but uh,1,0
sw2624B-ms98-a,78,B,281.476875,294.98,13.503125,but i'm a little bit unsympathetic with the families right here in our own small town of five thousand who have not limited their family we have three children and that happens to be what we could afford but,1,0
sw2624B-ms98-a,89,B,354.530125,363.35875,8.828625,and now two years later the court ordered that she be given back to the foster people i it's just awful it's just awful the whole thing,1,0

sw2635A-ms98-a,5,A,10.197875,21.81975,11.621875,um perhaps have a civic duty but i don't know as though it should be uh and i don't know if this uh was my interpretation was that perhaps it should be uh like a forced thing,2,0
sw2635A-ms98-a,6,A,21.81975,35.2565,13.43675,um i think it should all be voluntary as it is now but um i do agree that i think it is a good thing because i don't know how else a lot of these um things could happen if they didn't have the volunteers to do it,1,0
sw2635A-ms98-a,28,A,174.62475,178.265875,3.641125,be in a constant learning environment i- i don't know,1,0

sw2635A-ms98-a,77,A,466.755875,469.765,3.009125,really like you say something needs to be done about that too,1,0
sw2635A-ms98-a,83,A,485.605,497.377,11.772,apparently uh if we could get like we were discussing some people involved in this country like they want to be involved in other countries maybe we could do some some real good here,1,0
sw2635B-ms98-a,39,B,191.569875,198.531625,6.96175,you know we're supposedly on the leading edge of technology which uh that can be disputed i guess by a number of other countries,1,0
sw2635B-ms98-a,48,B,248.8,252.717625,3.917625,and they figure by five years the average speed is going to be eleven miles an hour,1,0
sw2635B-ms98-a,55,B,299.104375,307.681,8.576625,uh i think there should be mandatory that people that are not in school should at least get into some kind of a career program i mean they can help build the United States back up,1,0

sw2635B-ms98-a,118,B,584.067375,588.844375,4.777,and they're going to be apprehensive and if you had to choose between one or the other,1,0
sw2636B-ms98-a,34,B,199.486125,201.778,2.291875,than they used to be,1,0

sw2636B-ms98-a,40,B,242.70075,256.0585,13.35775,you know uh this is damaged you know and but it was fixable you know what i'm saying it's something you could bring home and repair and you'd be willing to do that repair if you got price off if you got mark down,1,0
sw2636B-ms98-a,57,B,350.184875,356.483875,6.299,but uh so it must be a heightened you know awareness that way the uh,1,0
sw2636B-ms98-a,71,B,433.734875,447.747125,14.01225,i was surprised i thought these girls you know won't be able to come up with that many different things we had so many countries represented it just it was really an eye opener for me far more probably      but,1,0

sw2638B-ms98-a,37,B,179.09225,189.6,10.50775,and i like the idea that they have a uh system where they allow you to uh be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up,1,0
sw2638B-ms98-a,47,B,215.765125,225.941125,10.176,i'm just glad that they uh decided not to uh tax drugs otherwise they'd be legal and they'd be getting tax money off it the same way they are the alcohol and  ,2,0

sw2640B-ms98-a,5,B,33.4565,47.887125,14.430625,uh people in jail that probably don't need to be there and it's another form of sentencing but on that one thing i- i still think it should be a unanimous decision uh i think we're getting to the point now where they're gonna eventually let it be um majority vote,3,0
sw2640B-ms98-a,6,B,47.887125,51.062375,3.17525,and that's not gonna be good no,1,0

sw2643B-ms98-a,54,B,202.139625,213.43175,11.292125,uh it used to be a pier and beam where they would drill piers and and the first you would have a crawl space underneath your house but that's phased out in the last twenty five years where it's all slab,1,0
sw2644A-ms98-a,15,A,49.220375,60.499875,11.2795,yeah i think it's it's when you're looking for a college that you want to go i think you really should know exactly what you want to be so you can pick the best quality,1,0
sw2644A-ms98-a,39,A,252.291125,262.7285,10.437375,so i'm kind of branching off into a pretty specific region which i think is going to be a hot topic in the future with you know all these lands and and things that are being spoiled,1,0
sw2644B-ms98-a,35,B,165.2195,179.495625,14.276125,type of emphasis now agriculture changes by region as far as it's emphasis is concerned middle of the country would be wheat land here it's tobacco and uh California it may be,2,0
sw2644B-ms98-a,61,B,334.955,339.997625,5.042625,and that's got to be solved i think there has to be public trust in it before you can,2,0
sw2645A-ms98-a,14,A,81.7375,87.996875,6.259375,ten percent of six fifty sixty five and twenty percent would be one thirty,1,0

sw2645B-ms98-a,64,B,300.2935,303.4865,3.193,it may be a blessing in disguise,1,0

sw2646A-ms98-a,7,A,47.49675,59.99825,12.5015,that uh those type of qualities have uh moved into the picture and then there's there's some economic concern but usually it's if if it's going to be a night out it's going to be a a decent meal and,2,0
sw2646A-ms98-a,16,A,129.467375,133.248875,3.7815,yeah there seem to be quite a few quite a few,1,0
sw2646A-ms98-a,21,A,152.49775,162.956625,10.458875,the whole east coast uh seafood for some reason it tends to be a draw i don't know particularly why i mean to me it tastes pretty much the same once you do to it whatever you're going to do to it you know like,1,0
sw2646A-ms98-a,26,A,175.739375,182.278375,6.539,uh probably i'm not a big fan of that so i wouldn't wouldn't be paying much attention to it um,1,0
sw2646A-ms98-a,47,A,435.287,447.2995,12.0125,so we went to this steak house once uh well several times but the most particular time that we were away from the kids and and had a a good length of time and it was on a Friday night and we knew the place would be really busy but we,1,0
sw2646B-ms98-a,25,B,123.74125,130.27175,6.5305,i imagine uh in in Texas there would be uh a lot of steak restaurants is that right,1,0
sw2646B-ms98-a,44,B,200.6285,206.976625,6.348125,definitely dine out more frequently probably several times a week and it didn't have to be,1,0
sw2646B-ms98-a,48,B,232.20575,238.2885,6.08275, places that you went before spur of the moment that might be nice but casual um,1,0
sw2646B-ms98-a,50,B,248.17325,256.76975,8.5965,when we do go out uh as you said you out on the t- now when we go out it's it's you want it to be more special ,1,0
sw2646B-ms98-a,88,B,578.768125,588.489125,9.721,um to children and making half price menus for them whereas before um they would be totally discouraged from bringing children in,1,0
sw2647A-ms98-a,23,A,80.9975,95.72675,14.72925,y- yeah i i could see i could see that point i could see how it would be i'm sure your classes were a lot smaller um because_1 like we would have biology classes that did main courses that everyone has to take i mean hundreds of students in this class so actually yes you were a number,1,0
sw2647A-ms98-a,28,A,124.26575,135.997125,11.731375,uh-huh uh-huh i think uh a lot of a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college a lot of the students that i talked to even here in Waco they go to Baylor um,1,0
sw2647A-ms98-a,55,A,258.75225,267.2975,8.54525,i was  i s- strived to be an A student but it wasn't like a real priority to my my priority was just,1,0
sw2647A-ms98-a,101,A,463.997875,469.251625,5.25375,and that that's another point is that the a parent should tell their child to be,1,0
sw2647B-ms98-a,4,B,62.978125,71.987875,9.00975,and backgrounds and so forth so i thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number um,1,0
sw2647B-ms98-a,22,B,217.918125,231.054125,13.136,the key would be wh- what are what are the chi- the the student's needs and what what school or schools can best meet those those needs besides education y- y- you can expect,1,0
sw2647B-ms98-a,41,B,360.482375,373.252875,12.7705,e- education in uh you know w- we weren't all out to be teachers or or whatever so we didn't have the same classes but we had a common thread something that still ties us together twenty odd years later ,1,0
sw2647B-ms98-a,43,B,378.791125,385.489,6.697875,those are what i carry beyond just that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at TI,1,0
sw2648A-ms98-a,11,A,66.342625,78.54275,12.200125,i mean it's better than it used to be but it's incredible that they still don't have you know they don't they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air,1,0
sw2648A-ms98-a,13,A,82.48775,92.7395,10.25175,that they get away with a lot that you know they're supposed to be regulated because we have a we have a plant i don't know about TI but we have a plant uh a Pillsbury plant,1,0
sw2648A-ms98-a,20,A,132.11,136.511,4.401,that they're not supposed to be dumping and i'm like if they're getting away with it,1,0
sw2648A-ms98-a,23,A,145.653875,160.554375,14.9005,yeah they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff you know to to break the flours down and then they they also do testing there and i don't you know wh- when you consider you know it's probably not radioactive but toxic can be,1,0
sw2648A-ms98-a,24,A,160.554375,165.6605,5.106125,can be anything that's  uh classified that can damage the Earth,1,0
sw2648A-ms98-a,25,A,165.6605,174.867875,9.207375,so there could be a lot of things that they could put you know that {chemicalwise} that they use to uh that they are testing with,1,0
sw2648A-ms98-a,39,A,225.9685,239.423625,13.455125,maybe to just i'm not really sure but i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down  or stream or such or you can you can you know do uh testing on the ground itself at that point,1,0
sw2648A-ms98-a,53,A,318.43075,331.4735,13.04275,because_1 dairies they don't th- th- it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free they've got to have them there to be able to milk them and they and i read in this article i couldn't believe it where you know like one cow produces like,1,0
sw2648A-ms98-a,62,A,390.948625,399.2145,8.265875,that it's they're wa- they're water in that town will be totally polluted and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have um polluted,2,0
sw2648A-ms98-a,77,A,500.197125,513.2195,13.022375,emphasizing the problem with acid rain you know if we if we keep putting that stuff into the air and and you know if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for um,1,0
sw2648B-ms98-a,109,B,482.366375,488.76,6.393625, i was going to say the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad,1,0
sw2648B-ms98-a,119,B,529.788625,542.569,12.780375,we've been wanting to well not me but uh it's been recommend- or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here i'm like no you know you know for what's cut down here you know more will be cut down someplace else and,1,0
sw2648B-ms98-a,125,B,557.901875,564.8875,6.985625,so uh yeah i knew i think there's lots that be that could be done to to improve how things are done now,2,0
sw2649A-ms98-a,8,A,41.031875,55.394,14.362125,yeah there used to be uh a big uh trash bin several trash bins in front of the Wal-Mart in town here that uh you could put plastic jugs on one side and newspapers on another and glass on the third,1,0
sw2649A-ms98-a,24,A,149.1815,163.067,13.8855,uh newspapers or whatever i mean they used to be that if you well like grocery stores you buy uh pop and and you had a deposit on the bottle you bring the bottle back you get a nickel per bottle back or whatever you know that encourages you not to throw it away you'd take it back and and,1,0
sw2649A-ms98-a,40,A,218.87975,221.622375,2.742625,there needs to be legislation that they should all be the same ,2,0
sw2649A-ms98-a,48,A,267.87725,272.124125,4.246875,and take them down and throw it in there i mean i think that would be great i i'd support that entirely because_1,1,0
sw2649B-ms98-a,11,B,89.710375,93.87225,4.161875,best person for recycling but i'll be damned if you know if they they didn't uh,1,0
sw2649B-ms98-a,12,B,93.87225,98.77275,4.9005,charge me an extra ten bucks for garbage collection every month i'd be sure and recycle,1,0
sw2649B-ms98-a,40,B,199.063125,201.411625,2.3485,what can be recycled as what,1,0

sw2649B-ms98-a,65,B,310.64925,319.911,9.26175,i guess there's the other side of the issue that uh there need to be facilities for processing all this stuff and a market for recyclable goods,1,0
sw2649B-ms98-a,71,B,348.61,356.422,7.812,so at the same time we're we're doing all this effort to throw it a way and recycle it we ought to be working on the other end and,1,0
sw2650A-ms98-a,66,A,522.430375,527.715875,5.2855,i don't know at first you know they seemed to be upset but now it's like um,1,0

sw2654A-ms98-a,136,A,486.326,492.369375,6.043375,that's got to be discouraging especially_1 if you've risked your life to to do course you know if you're a cop you expected to risk your life ,1,0

sw2657B-ms98-a,77,B,451.995,461.487,9.492,and here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think probably need help and could be helped,1,0
sw2657B-ms98-a,81,B,469.786875,483.253375,13.4665,and maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like um during college you know maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work and,1,0
sw2657B-ms98-a,84,B,494.208625,504.733625,10.525,there probably are you know for but i'm sure that's probably like people that do that are s- are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn't really be,1,0
sw2657B-ms98-a,86,B,510.67675,522.9975,12.32075,to um help these people you know and no- i'm not saying just give them_1 money but i mean because_1 they have to be taught to be yeah  i mean i know that's what my father-in-law was talking about you know when you give these people,2,0
sw2658A-ms98-a,32,A,144.05075,153.757875,9.707125,and at this point we only have one board so it wasn't so bad so we used it a bit but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because_1 we really need to be able to put at least three in,1,0
sw2658A-ms98-a,36,A,162.66225,170.184375,7.522125,and even though they told us in advance that you could they told us there'd be no problem because_1 you know the salesman just doesn't really know,1,0

sw2658A-ms98-a,111,A,562.16625,576.9215,14.75525,give the attitude that well you know you're the last one hired so you'll be the first one fired and we just want you to do your days work and we don't really care about you as an individual when you've got that type of attitude on the people don't care about their work and so,1,0
sw2658B-ms98-a,53,B,254.702,265.969125,11.267125,now that's an advantage isn't it it really is i think uh uh there's a lot not to be said for credit but that's one thing to be said for credit it how it gets you some muscle where you need it,2,0

sw2659A-ms98-a,13,A,62.786125,73.328,10.541875,uh in this particular French restaurant was our problem to be going back again and again uh they there were three waiters that waited on the entire restaurant they just all kept an eye on all the tables,1,0
sw2659A-ms98-a,29,A,158.97025,171.2565,12.28625,whereas someone that actually is there that owns it that you know has been working there for twenty years or so they want they want you to be happy so you get the service and you know of course with that will come the good food,1,0

sw2662A-ms98-a,23,A,105.95225,110.403625,4.451375,and i suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it,1,0
sw2662A-ms98-a,30,A,144.075125,152.284,8.208875,yeah i think that that Ghost was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good and it turned out to be an excellent movie,2,0
sw2662A-ms98-a,34,A,164.541875,170.935625,6.39375,other than that Dances with Wolves seems like to be the the only thing i've seen in the past several months to have any uh,1,0
sw2662A-ms98-a,64,A,297.437375,305.032375,7.595,and uh wh- what exactly do we you know do we see about this world or why are we so fascinated with the other world is it just supposed to be better,1,0

sw2662B-ms98-a,45,B,197.92175,208.370375,10.448625,so  so it's lot better um M- Mel Brooks you you probably know is uh you know so i- it was a strange combination but it turned out to be a very cute movie i mean the whole premise is that they go out and they they die,1,0
sw2662B-ms98-a,53,B,265.204375,272.56575,7.361375,i was i wa- i was i i w- i went in thinking it'll be okay not great and then i actually came away thinking it was really pretty good so,1,0
sw2663A-ms98-a,12,A,78.8935,88.710875,9.817375,you know they're liable to be right that that generals generals in the service and Schwartzkopf uh you know might make a good uh politician whether it be Governor or whatever you know,2,0

sw2663A-ms98-a,37,A,243.067875,257.175625,14.10775,i think voting is a prob- i think i had one of the subject about voting and uh voting apathy or something like that and i think that uh the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time i- i can't believe that a country our big,1,0
sw2663A-ms98-a,38,A,257.175625,269.302875,12.12725,votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning till seven o'clock at night you know of course they have absentee which is getting to be more a lot easier and i- i vote as often on absentee as i can because it's so easy now but,1,0

sw2663B-ms98-a,37,B,163.631,167.03475,3.40375,that may be our only answer but i don't really like it,1,0
sw2663B-ms98-a,39,B,170.9415,177.642,6.7005,because i think if the President be him Republican or Democrat i think if the President can prove,1,0
sw2663B-ms98-a,40,B,177.642,190.288375,12.646375,that he's popular you know that he can do the job then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want i think the reason why we've got these guys in congress is because of the fund-raising rules i mean,1,0
sw2663B-ms98-a,46,B,227.573625,236.500875,8.92725,that's that's the easy way i think the harder way out would be to make the uh the guys that are in there and the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground,1,0

sw2666A-ms98-a,105,A,403.310875,416.39975,13.088875,it it's pretty obvious though like Corbin Benson is probably not going to be there long because_1 he's been starring in these uh miniseries and and his part's gotten smaller and smaller and they're bringing on the uh like the British uh lawyer who uh,1,0
sw2666B-ms98-a,7,B,28.61675,31.8995,3.28275,and it looks like it would be an a good series,1,0
sw2666B-ms98-a,34,B,149.413875,154.05025,4.636375, should be interesting  right lots of tongue in cheek ,1,0

sw2680A-ms98-a,23,A,88.72275,95.6695,6.94675,a majority for uh you know a less severe case would be okay but i think for a death penalty it would be have to be everybody,3,0
sw2680A-ms98-a,28,A,112.42925,119.446,7.01675,i've always said that i you know i i think that would be the stiffer penalty but we have such a problem with over crowding right now that,1,0
sw2680A-ms98-a,40,A,196.069875,203.322,7.252125,he was tough and so sometimes probably the judge might be a little bit more sev- severe than the jury would,1,0
sw2680A-ms98-a,62,A,280.948125,293.76725,12.819125,i think that they they wouldn't be too lenient with certain people because they're they're so hardened to the fact that you know there's a reason why all this happened and they don't want to hear the story anymore they just want them to you know go to jail or be punished,2,0
sw2680A-ms98-a,63,A,293.76725,298.742125,4.974875,so i agree with you i'm not too sure i would like to have a judge be the sole,1,0

sw2680A-ms98-a,83,A,393.513125,397.886625,4.3735,i could not be lenient at all and they asked me a couple of questions and i think,1,0
sw2680A-ms98-a,104,A,496.503,502.232625,5.729625,and if you don't truly believe what you think and stick to your guns it can be awful uncomfortable,1,0
sw2680A-ms98-a,111,A,530.58875,534.551875,3.963125,oh wouldn't that be awful yeah that would be terrible,2,0

sw2680B-ms98-a,112,B,518.91725,521.82725,2.91,it would be hard on a person that uh,1,0
sw2680B-ms98-a,113,B,521.82725,527.89175,6.0645,if he did not get that pay to get locked up for two or three weeks on a hung jury and be out,1,0

sw2692A-ms98-a,39,A,198.1235,207.13525,9.01175,we always fix things and  put things in and walk away we there needs to be a time of inspection and check out and and some thing like that with a car there ought to be someone there,2,0
sw2692A-ms98-a,40,A,207.13525,221.0955,13.96025,that inspects it before it's turned there ought to be an insp- inspector or quality insurance guy after after an oil change you know just in case uh they didn't put the oil in or whatever you know i i always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh ,1,0
sw2692B-ms98-a,45,B,223.371625,238.054125,14.6825,gets to be an an assembly line type operation you're you're always risking that if there's too many people that get their hands on one little project you know that things they're you get y- you miss that overlap sometimes and and and they miss things yeah i've i've had a hard time ,1,0

sw2693B-ms98-a,67,B,380.691375,392.9775,12.286125,well no i don't think so i think it's just your because i i prefer to be waited on too i just if you're going to go out to eat why not have the whole service you know why why not get the whole,1,0
sw2693B-ms98-a,108,B,583.77625,591.17075,7.3945,oh they tend to be you know American style food and we don't have too many wh- you have to go all the way to Dallas,1,0

sw2694A-ms98-a,34,A,135.6985,143.999125,8.300625,i- i guess you know the money has to be spent and that car has to be taken care of but you would hope that uh people would be a little bit more honest with you,3,0
sw2695B-ms98-a,53,B,196.23425,206.77175,10.5375,uh it's not typical Robin Williams i you know i expected some comedy or something like that but he he's a good dramatic ac- actor when he wants to be,1,0

sw2696A-ms98-a,94,A,464.77225,467.7915,3.01925,yeah it'll it'll have to be well you know,1,0
sw2697A-ms98-a,77,A,388.74275,391.7055,2.96275,but they can be very dangerous if you don't,1,0
sw2697B-ms98-a,11,B,57.498875,71.99675,14.497875,so i guess our budget is just what's in our checkbook we don't say we have x amount for entertainment x amount for gas it's just we know some weeks we might be able to go out for dinner two times some weeks one time some weeks three times,1,0
sw2697B-ms98-a,39,B,173.8405,185.470375,11.629875,whatever you think some of your major medical expenses are going to be for the year such as any prescriptions um if you wear glasses or contacts any expenses you might have for that,1,0
sw2697B-ms98-a,40,B,185.470375,198.670625,13.20025,any dental expenses you anticipate if you have kids day care that sort of thing um outside of a major medical hospitalization problem anything that that might be medically related,1,0
sw2697B-ms98-a,56,B,302.038875,312.740125,10.70125,they let you know each quarter and they'll let you know you have three hundred dollars left two hundred dollars left but if it gets to be the end of the year and you haven't spent that fifty then you do lose it,1,0
sw2697B-ms98-a,89,B,431.463875,437.147,5.683125,well it'll be a long time before that's something we can retire on but um,1,0
sw2697B-ms98-a,95,B,484.685875,497.998375,13.3125,but it would be nice to just not always think about saving like have a have a twenty dollar bill and think oh maybe we'll just go out and buy something with this and it'll come,1,0
sw2698A-ms98-a,15,A,33.6585,37.183375,3.524875,how could you be from Texas and not like football right,1,0
sw2698A-ms98-a,72,A,240.073875,253.72775,13.653875,yeah well it will be interesting to see w- especially you know um uh here here in the in the bay area you know th- this used to be the home also of the of the of of the Raiders and,2,0
sw2698A-ms98-a,74,A,260.45225,272.152625,11.700375, i i- it's going to be real interesting to see what happens because uh th- there're a lot of changes are happening here in the bay area as far as that they're talking about maybe getting a new stadium and with those guys leaving i mean,1,0
sw2698A-ms98-a,76,A,284.480625,288.302375,3.82175,gee going to be interesting to see what happens,1,0
sw2698A-ms98-a,84,A,315.907875,322.1025,6.194625,well uh i'm sure he wants to but i would be i'd frankly,1,0
sw2698A-ms98-a,87,A,331.594125,343.516875,11.92275,well i- i hope he does you know more power to him i think that'd be just absolutely wonderful so do you i- i guess uh uh i- i've talked with a lot of folks from from Texas it,1,0
sw2698B-ms98-a,32,B,78.1475,80.5155,2.368,so they're not going to be as good this year huh,1,0
sw2698B-ms98-a,73,B,214.2255,222.648375,8.422875,and uh they it looks looks to be promising for Purdue within the next few years so we're looking forward to seeing their program turn around,1,0
sw2698B-ms98-a,96,B,323.97675,325.815125,1.838375,yeah i would be too,1,0
sw2699A-ms98-a,10,A,32.775,42.51775,9.74275,so but this one i mean i like this one a lot um if i were to get a new car i it may be a Ni- a another uh Nissan,1,0
sw2699A-ms98-a,42,A,155.34625,158.36975,3.0235,if you were to get another kind of car what would it be,1,0
sw2699A-ms98-a,88,A,285.721,290.945,5.224,i don't know i think i'll probably be hanging on to my Nissan for a while i guess here ,1,0
sw2699B-ms98-a,10,B,20.47425,25.0785,4.60425,about_1 two years yeah i see how long it be before you're ready to buy another one ,1,0
sw2699B-ms98-a,80,B,252.262375,263.26925,11.006875,uh i'm not too crazy about the looks of them and they look like some of them look like they might be dangerous you're  so you'd be sitting right up on the front with a lot of glass ,2,0
sw2699B-ms98-a,85,B,273.9245,285.205875,11.281375,but then uh then some of them i like the looks of that better you know to have have a little more vehicle in front of you between you and the oncoming traffic seems to me it'd be a little safer,1,0
sw2700A-ms98-a,19,A,75.840375,85.064875,9.2245,in in cities i think there there may be a possibility for certain law restricting firearms in certain areas maybe not the ownership,1,0
sw2700A-ms98-a,29,A,132.2695,142.172125,9.902625,you know how if if by having a gun how much that really helps so i don't really know that's why i think that maybe if not maybe not just having one will be better that's that's why,1,0
sw2700A-ms98-a,65,A,290.497375,295.784375,5.287,so if you say you can have it but you have to be a member of gun club that that restricts it even further,1,0
sw2700A-ms98-a,70,A,304.62525,311.696875,7.071625,i do- you know i think i think restrictions are going to be needed but no no bans or anything like that,1,0
sw2700A-ms98-a,88,A,390.843125,395.326,4.482875,it it may be well intended but i don't know how effective it is,1,0
sw2700B-ms98-a,4,B,8.6425,22.06,13.4175,now i live in Dallas where there's a lot of crime and i'm all for uh the average Joe being able to have a gun but then again i'm not you know as far as this seven day law and all this stuff for two weeks or whatever i'm all for that too i don't think anybody needs to be able to go buy a gun right away,1,0
sw2700B-ms98-a,5,B,22.06,25.536875,3.476875,if you want a gun for a legitimate purpose you should be willing to wait,1,0
sw2700B-ms98-a,10,B,39.6375,44.411875,4.774375,is important and you know we we should be allowed to have guns,1,0
sw2700B-ms98-a,26,B,169.7135,172.148875,2.435375,i think there need to be stronger,1,0
sw2700B-ms98-a,27,B,172.148875,175.331,3.182125,gun control laws that can be that can uh,1,0
sw2700B-ms98-a,30,B,181.19025,190.78925,9.599,but uh i don't think guns should be banned i just think it should be harder for for a criminal to get hold of them and of course the black market anyone can get one if they want one,2,0
sw2700B-ms98-a,53,B,327.1525,330.994375,3.841875,a pistol would be fine it's more for a scare tactic than anything else,1,0
sw2700B-ms98-a,84,B,460.734625,463.967125,3.2325,i would think if they're going to make a law it would have to be something uh,1,0
sw2700B-ms98-a,85,B,463.967125,467.43275,3.465625,it'd be a crime to uh not enforce it,1,0
sw2701A-ms98-a,54,A,242.156375,253.250625,11.09425,unusual for something like that to be nationally televised uh or or have anybody come in you know who who would want to have that televised you know if that was happening to your daughter,1,0
sw2701B-ms98-a,25,B,106.0125,109.9275,3.915,so you catch whatever might be on if you're interested that evening,1,0
sw2701B-ms98-a,49,B,221.720875,226.070125,4.34925,it could be a mul- like one of these multiple personality disorders,1,0
sw2701B-ms98-a,110,B,483.777875,491.7545,7.976625,eh eh i eh it might be the Beverly Hills um there's that one called Beverly Hills one O two one O or something like that uh,1,0
sw2701B-ms98-a,116,B,517.27775,529.1895,11.91175,what changes would you like to see i mean in in in you know evening television do you think there should be more like news type programs like 20/20 or more comedies or weeklies,1,0
sw2702A-ms98-a,1,A,0,11.43175,11.43175,well as much as i'd uh i'd like to say that i'll be looking for a flashy convertible or a or a four by four or something i guess the next car i'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door ,2,0
sw2702A-ms98-a,3,A,13.61125,27.79625,14.185,oh we've got a uh an older Delta Eighty Eight and then uh our our newer car is a uh a Corsica and uh we'll probably be looking for something about that uh that same style that same kind of four door hard top style and,1,0
sw2702A-ms98-a,42,A,183.618875,191.211125,7.59225,and when i got there the first thing i did was trade it in on a Spitfire and i- i knew that was gonna be the only time i could afford a two seater uh sports car,1,0
sw2702A-ms98-a,91,A,382.505625,391.76725,9.261625,now now now that used to be a luxury but i bet on the next time you buy a car that's gonna be mandatory  you've got to have that now you're used to it and you got to have it,2,0
sw2702B-ms98-a,16,B,48.916375,57.885625,8.96925,yeah that'll do it um but yeah we're we're in the same shape i think our next car will be a you know some big old four door  uh,1,0
sw2703A-ms98-a,98,A,404.247,415.57325,11.32625,it's uh something we're really irritated about around here or some people are really irritated about they're they're building this new sta- they built the new stadium downtown and they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium,1,0
sw2703A-ms98-a,100,A,422.203875,425.272375,3.0685,and um i'm not going to be able to do that downtown ,1,0
sw2703B-ms98-a,9,B,29.174125,40.048125,10.874,you know i would love to to be able to read more because i i enjoy it so much but with correcting papers and and i two of kids of my own i just don't have time but in the summer i try to read a lot,1,0
sw2703B-ms98-a,13,B,61.98275,72.515125,10.532375,and uh but uh i don't read a lot of nonfiction and i really should because there's so many self-improvement books out right now that would would be benefit me greatly but i just don't,1,0
sw2703B-ms98-a,96,B,365.10325,373.80275,8.6995,oh yeah and the food here is outrageous but uh you can get a good seat for uh well it used to be three dollars but i think it's gone up to fou- four dollars this year,1,0
sw2703B-ms98-a,150,B,592.852125,594.422625,1.5705,oh that would be good,1,0
sw2704A-ms98-a,35,A,136.48975,144.661,8.17125,well you know anymore they can they can be anywhere and and and almost talk to anyone instantly it seems like,1,0
sw2704A-ms98-a,61,A,260.927375,271.60575,10.678375,well yeah you know tha- there's not enough money in the world for me to be up there in uh in probably the highest building in Baghdad while all these bombs are going off i mean,1,0
sw2704B-ms98-a,9,B,38.088875,42.47,4.381125, that got to be kind of silly so i cut that out,1,0
sw2704B-ms98-a,44,B,206.990375,213.349375,6.359,so that just uh you know that's a a a little lesson on how the experts can be,1,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,38,A,81.46725,93.887,12.41975,well we have a really large house we have three kids and we bought a five bedroom house when we moved here and um it's getting to be too much  too much work to keep it up,1,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,42,A,112.249875,122.898125,10.64825,and um my youngest one got to be three years old and so then i went back to work and i decided after a year of being a secretary that what i really wanted to do was go back and get my master's ,1,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,44,A,127.378875,141.2285,13.849625,and uh it's getting to be too much financially too without my full time income so we're we're just decided to put last week to put our house on the market and um get a smaller house not too small though with three ,1,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,48,A,170.597875,177.321375,6.7235,and when you have this much space you don't have to be as careful about throwing stuff out you just put it in the garage or put it in the playroom or something,1,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,79,A,259.95825,269.88025,9.922,i think well i don't i really have uh really relaxed standards about how well organized and cleaned it is i mean it has to be basically clean because_1,1,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,80,A,269.88025,279.28925,9.409,you have to be organized e- enough to know where things are to be able to find things if it gets too messy you spend your whole life going through trying to find what you need,2,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,91,A,342.944625,351.25125,8.306625,so if we had a smaller house  everything would be smaller and it it wouldn't take w- it took us two weekends to put all the wallpaper up you know,1,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,93,A,352.49375,355.069375,2.575625,but i have a feeling it's going to be hard,1,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,98,A,377.232,384.006875,6.774875,that this house will be good enough for people to come through and look at it and then i want to start going to some open houses and,1,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,107,A,423.622,433.661,10.039,and it is five bedrooms she said you you it's really hard to find that and most places places have four and there are people that really want five so that's another plus so it might be closer to three months,1,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,108,A,433.661,442.567,8.906,and you know we'll be if we're real lucky we won't lose any money you know we'll we'll be able it's mostly the closing costs that are going to,2,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,109,A,442.567,452.576875,10.009875,that y- we can we'll be be uh asking for more than we bought the house for three years ago but the closing costs are going to eat out just about all of it so,2,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,119,A,484.62825,495.50775,10.8795,the time     i have finals right now because i'm taking two classes i have finals and papers and stuff so in um two weeks from now i should be pretty well set,1,0
sw2705A-ms98-a,120,A,495.50775,506.87925,11.3715,and uh i'm going to go out there and look i'm going to tell her i- i want to know i want to have a feeling before i sign saying i'm going to sell this house i have to see what exactly it is that we're going to be moving into,1,0
sw2705B-ms98-a,41,B,209.265125,215.44625,6.181125,it's going to be great though it makes it gives you a good feeling when you've got clean out the stuff and get rid of it,1,0
sw2705B-ms98-a,78,B,401.119625,407.819625,6.7,well uh well are prices holding you know you be able to get what you've got in that house you think,1,0
sw2705B-ms98-a,107,B,535.358,542.778375,7.420375,when i bought this house was actually it's be in May it'll be five years and uh,2,0
sw2705B-ms98-a,112,B,568.210375,575.314625,7.10425,yeah well but then again i- i didn't care if it went down as long as i don't want to sell it because_1 then i have my taxes are going to be less but,1,0
sw2706A-ms98-a,19,A,77.454625,90.481125,13.0265,i feel that one of the things that happens in this country is that uh you know engineers become what i call clerical engineers they spend their time pushing paper and doing mundane tasks that could be assigned to uh to other people,1,0
sw2706B-ms98-a,22,B,99.692125,112.717125,13.025,uh i'm with TI of course and our our benefits it it's interesting uh because that's one of the biggest gripes in the company is the benefits whether it be the health insurance or or the food or  or other things,1,0
sw2706B-ms98-a,28,B,151.173,165.76525,14.59225,and uh uh which i don't like i got the opportunity to go with another company in fact uh a uh a semiconductor uh uh assembly house that supplies us uh where the uh where the job will be a hundred percent going into their various plants trouble shooting,1,0
sw2706B-ms98-a,49,B,300.429,312.998375,12.569375,uh i have eighty five days vacation and and it would have been nice to been able to use up fifteen of them in April but i had so many things i had to do before i finished i didn't get to do that so i'm in essence going to be giving those back to the company or most of them back,1,0
sw2706B-ms98-a,54,B,334.987125,347.95425,12.967125,three years or four years or something like that you can be sick up to six months and still get paid and and and uh uh that uh do you have a uh long and short term disability program,1,0
sw2706B-ms98-a,97,B,587.644125,594.2245,6.580375,and uh write to them all and tell them_1 that they've got an opportunity  to be part of this program and they and,1,0
sw2707B-ms98-a,12,B,44.352875,58.602875,14.25,uh in fact you you could easily do that now listen to turn on a talk show up there and see if there there's got to be some gardening folks on the radio that says when to put your grass in and and what kind of grass to grow up in Virginia and everything so i uh,1,0
sw2707B-ms98-a,21,B,91.617,94.98225,3.36525,the part i don't like i guess would be from December,1,0
sw2707B-ms98-a,54,B,227.468,231.084,3.616,get some books of whether it be Pennsylvania or Virginia,1,0
sw2707B-ms98-a,122,B,523.198875,526.6815,3.482625,i think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop uh,1,0
sw2707B-ms98-a,134,B,575.262,577.8995,2.6375,you know so you it's going to be much faster,1,0
sw2708A-ms98-a,6,A,13.82,17.539625,3.719625,what would you start cutting f- what would be the first thing you'd cut,1,0
sw2708A-ms98-a,64,A,293.980625,307.885375,13.90475,um-hum well yeah i i'm well ye- i you know i'm assuming that it can be done uh my perspective is that you know i've been with a couple of big companies now and it's like they'd are unwilling to put the time in,1,0
sw2708B-ms98-a,19,B,80.87,87.634125,6.764125,well see the other way i'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting like um the prisoners make,1,0
sw2708B-ms98-a,20,B,87.634125,98.762125,11.128,license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves in other words they're in there for a purpose put them to work,1,0
sw2708B-ms98-a,33,B,147.48,149.75675,2.27675,i would like to be a little more,1,0
sw2708B-ms98-a,46,B,230.7495,239.754125,9.004625,which of course again which m- would mean again our education budget will go down if this is in a few years i mean it's not going to be overnight,1,0
sw2708B-ms98-a,59,B,376.631875,381.429875,4.798,well that's something about what Germany's supposed to be doing something similar to that right now,1,0
sw2709A-ms98-a,2,A,69.895625,84.6465,14.750875,right actually my son once said that that perhaps um what we should do is is buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest and and that might be the solution ,1,0
sw2709A-ms98-a,12,A,154.69825,168.49675,13.7985,were in a sense not qualified is the wrong word but certainly were deserving to come and it seemed to take them a long time or or there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come,1,0
sw2709B-ms98-a,38,B,266.9605,277.299375,10.338875,they uh don't want to work for anything they want it to come to them but and be there but they don't want to work hard and these kids work really hard and and they have,1,0
sw2709B-ms98-a,61,B,453.656,460.999875,7.343875,yeah i do- i don't really either i wish i knew more and probably if i did i might be a little bit more uh tolerant,1,0
sw2709B-ms98-a,65,B,486.26675,495.036125,8.769375,well pardon me  yeah but in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they can they get in front of you or they ,1,0
sw2709B-ms98-a,67,B,509.232,514.995125,5.763125,and yet they have they have a right to be here and i know that but it's it sometimes it's gets touchy,1,0
sw2710B-ms98-a,3,B,7.733375,16.477375,8.744,so i went ahead and and accepted every one that i was offered because i knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early,1,0
sw2710B-ms98-a,51,B,279.769875,284.98475,5.214875,so i mean it's it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards,1,0
sw2710B-ms98-a,80,B,412.495375,415.4945,2.999125,might be worth it for peace of mind,1,0
sw2710B-ms98-a,89,B,470.495375,476.26125,5.765875,i would think it wouldn't be you know much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges,1,0
sw2710B-ms98-a,91,B,477.490125,480.69725,3.207125,so that that wouldn't be too bad,1,0
sw2711A-ms98-a,171,A,514.997375,522.95225,7.954875,there's a beauty to the desert that it can most be it can best be appreciated when you are not burning up,2,0
sw2711B-ms98-a,89,B,282.405125,283.985125,1.58,that would be neat ,1,0
sw2712A-ms98-a,9,A,26.662125,29.500125,2.838,so it's going to be almost four hours before it's over,1,0
sw2712A-ms98-a,31,A,149.278625,157.256375,7.97775,yeah yeah i'll i'll go see a drama like uh when the Untouchables came out which is another Kevin Costner movie well this is going to be a rut isn't it,1,0
sw2712A-ms98-a,124,A,462.08875,469.4385,7.34975,i mean you really it really had to be on a big screen i think especially for Jack Nicholson to come across because because_1 i mean what he did was so corny,1,0
sw2712A-ms98-a,132,A,504.797,514.466375,9.669375,i- i liked it till about a half hour from the from the end it looked it looked like it was going to be a funny movie and and until about until it got to be almost too much,2,0
sw2712A-ms98-a,147,A,581.173625,587.899875,6.72625,and uh she i was really dis- i think we we were both disappointed in fact for some reason although it looked like it was going to be funny,1,0
sw2712B-ms98-a,59,B,155.83475,158.07125,2.2365,my gosh you're you must be a big fan of his,1,0
sw2712B-ms98-a,68,B,176.75875,187.8425,11.08375,i guess the last movie i saw was at Scenes From the Mall with Woody Allen and Bette Midler and i- i guess you just have to be a big Woody Allen fan which i'm not i think you either hate him or like him,1,0
sw2712B-ms98-a,101,B,299.03575,302.542125,3.506375,i know i just see it advertise on TV and it really looks like it is going to be a,1,0
sw2712B-ms98-a,163,B,496.757125,501.383,4.625875,oh now that would be good i like him oh did you see uh War of the Roses,1,0
sw2713A-ms98-a,30,A,107.62825,115.059625,7.431375,my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine and i have one too and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long,1,0
sw2713A-ms98-a,49,A,217.633625,226.420875,8.78725,uncourteous thing an an invasion of everyone else's time and and concentration to just be loud i don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and,1,0
sw2713A-ms98-a,69,A,349.599,356.075125,6.476125,financial uh applications that you make out you don't have to put all that stuff down there it would be nice to know what's what was,1,0
sw2713A-ms98-a,70,A,356.075125,366.167875,10.09275,of course of course they could say well i can't give you a card and you could say fine but you know some things will be private you know but he said just put N A and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your,1,0
sw2713A-ms98-a,103,A,503.6515,511.283625,7.632125,uh of course that would really be a big thing in a public school but uh i'm saying certainly at work i have no problem with it uh,1,0
sw2713B-ms98-a,48,B,242.9185,246.244,3.3255,uh be giving out information,1,0
sw2713B-ms98-a,80,B,458.411125,470.26225,11.851125,it's just one of those things you just do it and be done with it and don't worry about you know but i do know that there are several sites i didn't i wasn't aware that Austin was one of them but i think Johnson City was one,1,0
sw2713B-ms98-a,91,B,524.911375,532.98275,8.071375,necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it  and  on an individual basis i mean if they're going to do it just deal with it and be done with it ,1,0
sw2713B-ms98-a,100,B,590.655625,593.01575,2.360125,will uh be a problem,1,0
sw2714A-ms98-a,27,A,120.37625,129.953375,9.577125,that Congress ought not to be allowed to pass any new tax laws say every four or five years instead of every year,1,0
sw2714A-ms98-a,35,A,151.8495,163.809375,11.959875,uh that's another thing too i've often often wondered seemed to be when i was growing up i learned in Civics or Government that uh the House of Representatives has to initiate all,1,0
sw2714A-ms98-a,57,A,290.952,297.462375,6.510375,buy something that's right because you you are afraid your allocation will be cut the next year and,1,0
sw2714A-ms98-a,73,A,386.67725,392.739875,6.062625,oh i know i'm surprised the feasibility study could be done for that ,1,0
sw2714A-ms98-a,98,A,517.647125,522.470125,4.823,it will be interesting to see if we have any any impetus to go on to the national,1,0
sw2714B-ms98-a,8,B,16.50575,25.99225,9.4865,that's right and i think that anything we can do to improve the federal budget would be  a boon to everybody no matter where they are in the country,1,0
sw2714B-ms98-a,17,B,70.940875,75.714625,4.77375,  i i hope in this case the rest of you will be  ,1,0
sw2714B-ms98-a,27,B,139.0545,152.473875,13.419375,well that's certainly true we can get hit uh a lot of corporations at least seem to get blindsided by taxes that are sometimes even retroactive which i would have thought was then unconstitutional  but doesn't turn out to be,1,0
sw2714B-ms98-a,35,B,203.868875,216.15025,12.281375,of his group i mean it has his name but he was just the administrator of it of places where things like government purchasing could be rationalized where uh,1,0
sw2714B-ms98-a,36,B,216.15025,230.458875,14.308625,renting of space could be made much more efficient where a lot of the accounting is just you know incredibly Byzantine and could be straightened out and where lots of different government activities are redundant,2,0
sw2714B-ms98-a,46,B,271.554,282.643625,11.089625,it absolutely boggled my mind the way they budgeted because there was no uh an attempt to figure out what it really should cost to do what we should be doing,1,0
sw2714B-ms98-a,53,B,318.62575,327.97,9.34425,we might come up short next year if we haven't spent everything this year and so no matter how foolish the expenditure be sure we get rid of that money,1,0
sw2714B-ms98-a,72,B,440.5145,451.598,11.0835,and when we're talking about adding that much to a budget where it's just already in the hole just the think about the amount of interest we'll be paying on that we'll probably more than double it,1,0
sw2715A-ms98-a,5,A,13.153,16.498625,3.345625,it's it- it's supposed to be on the instruction sheet but,1,0
sw2715A-ms98-a,67,A,211.873625,219.153875,7.28025,um-hum yeah i don't think anybody would you know i don't think they can put the colored paper on there or something so that should be pretty difficult,1,0
sw2715A-ms98-a,68,A,219.153875,229.0125,9.858625,i don't recycle myse- i live i'm single and so  i guess if i had a family i'd probably be more aware than now that i am single but uh,1,0

sw2715B-ms98-a,13,B,41.985875,46.2975,4.311625,my wife happens to be a secretary in the i- in the group that does this,1,0
sw2715B-ms98-a,115,B,516.5435,524.759375,8.215875,you can't always i mean it'd be nice if you could if the landfill space was reusable but it i- it all it it isn't alw- i know sometimes it is,1,0
sw2716A-ms98-a,10,A,34.089,43.17925,9.09025,yeah yeah yeah i feel like there should be some kind coverage made but i i am really leery of um ,1,0

sw2720B-ms98-a,47,B,391.327875,400.191,8.863125,and at the most they probably spend five hours in their classes and five hours that they're required to be in their office that's ten hours a week they're probably making more,1,0
sw2720B-ms98-a,49,B,411.23575,425.956375,14.720625,professors  they have other jobs like some of them may be accountants and they do accounting you know and this is just to me it seems like it's a hobby to them and i don't and i've even expressed to some of my professors i don't think it's right,1,0
sw2720B-ms98-a,50,B,425.956375,439.591,13.634625,as i think they should be spending more time and too they they teach the same class year after year well i know one professor he comes up from Pittsburgh you know and he hasn't changed his tests,1,0
sw2720B-ms98-a,57,B,493.760125,502.41175,8.651625,me and along with other students we we have the same complaints year after year and nothing seems to be getting done so i don't know if they even,1,0
sw2721A-ms98-a,4,A,35.497625,45.935375,10.43775, yeah i think um  i i'm a i'm an advocate of uh gun control  um Maryland i think you'd be surprised is is very pro gun control ,1,0
sw2721A-ms98-a,20,A,149.699625,164.48,14.780375,is to get and this is very active in the po- politics here in Maryland now then  the long run there's also there's a bill being trying to be passed right now i guess through fe- the federal legislature on um  instant checkups a a total computerized system,1,0
sw2721A-ms98-a,22,A,166.4235,170.10725,3.68375,right and it's year it's years away but i- it will be,1,0
sw2721A-ms98-a,23,A,170.10725,182.548375,12.441125,it probably will be implemented on the East Coast first because the FBI headquarters is here in in Virginia and the this will probably be the places that will start to come in faster so yeah it will take a while before um,2,0
sw2721A-ms98-a,25,A,197.109125,209.002125,11.893,the um  the new bill until they can actually have a computerized system and i think the idea of the Brady Bill is to have this seven day waiting period to be able to check up on gun purchases or whatever,1,0
sw2721A-ms98-a,36,A,239.98075,249.03725,9.0565,well i don't think he would have been i think that his his type of crime i don't i don't think he would have been i think a street criminal would be you know like what you find in Washington DC,1,0
sw2721A-ms98-a,37,A,249.03725,257.836625,8.799375,they would be capable of doing it i don't think this fellow would have i think i think the idea is that they also um my idea too is to remove the automatic weapons from,1,0
sw2721A-ms98-a,38,A,257.836625,263.49125,5.654625,from the markets you know not to be able to purchase walk into a store and buy an automatic weapon ,1,0
sw2721A-ms98-a,46,A,284.584,294.2445,9.6605,you know the whole world but i just think that right now we should do a little bit better checking and and um and i- i believe totally that automatic weapons should not be sold in this country,1,0
sw2721A-ms98-a,61,A,393.2055,408.15625,14.95075,right yeah and see now and if it doesn't work i would be the first one to say you know just like prohibition didn't work if it doesn't work i think i'd be one of the first ones to say okay you know it hasn't worked in five years it hasn't reduced any crime the statistics still show the same so,2,0
sw2721A-ms98-a,76,A,492.007875,505.29975,13.291875,yeah see and in the back of my mind if we save one life if if you save one life you have to wait seven days probably less because if you have a clean record it probably would be faster than seven days you know but you have to wait seven,1,0
sw2721B-ms98-a,3,B,10.8545,21.4275,10.573,the way i feel about it that uh you know it would be nice if you get could get rid of guns completely although i do like to shoot them for sport but i don't think you're going to be able to do that and to make it difficult,2,0
sw2721B-ms98-a,21,B,162.05525,166.853625,4.798375,i've heard about that but they say it's so so going to be so expensive they'll never do it,1,0
sw2721B-ms98-a,25,B,227.31775,232.277,4.95925,that's t- they that may be true but if he wanted a gun,1,0
sw2721B-ms98-a,41,B,320.10625,334.2545,14.14825,well yeah i'm you know i just you know i just couldn't understand what uh Sar- Sarah Brady just needs something to do i mean this doesn't seem to be you know what is she really going to accomplish if this goes through i mean it's really not going to solve anything,1,0
sw2721B-ms98-a,83,B,571.20325,574.484125,3.280875,sure would be nice to feel safe again wouldn't it,1,0
sw2722B-ms98-a,27,B,156.6355,163.955125,7.319625,into those kinds of things but i don't think i would be satisfied if all i had was just television,1,0

sw2723A-ms98-a,20,A,72.834125,81.872625,9.0385,that well that one certainly is high i i worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening so i like to reverse that trend and say i'd like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better,1,0
sw2723A-ms98-a,49,A,195.12475,203.45,8.32525,yeah they seem to be do- doing a good job of that i'm in facilities an- and our organization  built builds those facilities over in Park Central now,1,0

sw2723A-ms98-a,74,A,308.133,317.981,9.848,no no there isn't i i'm saying that's the question what do you think could be better and i'm saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will,1,0
sw2723A-ms98-a,80,A,342.856,351.245375,8.389375,and you won't have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it it's there you don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know,1,0
sw2723A-ms98-a,85,A,356.93025,365.622875,8.692625,yeah and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company maybe you had to put some money in it too i don't really know,1,0
sw2723A-ms98-a,92,A,391.230625,397.685625,6.455,you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together,1,0

sw2728A-ms98-a,56,A,219.500375,230.90975,11.409375,no and i think that's part of the lure is is just to be uh relaxed and with the world and no pressure not not worrying about whether you catch anything or not,1,0
sw2728B-ms98-a,51,B,207.765375,220.0305,12.265125,no i kn- i know a lot of friends are really too hyper to fish they have to be moving all the time i think you have to be able to sit and and just enjoy yourself quietly if you can't do that you're not going to make a good fisherman,2,0
sw2728B-ms98-a,55,B,230.097375,237.194625,7.09725,well in this day and age that's wonderful to be able to do that    our lives are so stressful so,1,0
sw2728B-ms98-a,58,B,253.17375,259.50825,6.3345,once or twice but and there's just not that many lakes around here that i'd be interested in in going to and so,1,0
sw2729A-ms98-a,42,A,219.849375,228.138125,8.28875,she she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing but,1,0
sw2729A-ms98-a,127,A,533.629875,538.50225,4.872375,previews for it and all and it did look like it'd be a good mo- movie but uh,1,0
sw2729A-ms98-a,143,A,591.434,598.053625,6.619625,yeah well it's been nice talking to you we seem to be degenerating here so ,1,0
sw2730A-ms98-a,9,A,53.250875,65.86925,12.618375,it's work i- i- i just th- th- there there's got to be a better way of incorporating it you know somehow so that the manufacturers uh,1,0
sw2730A-ms98-a,13,A,126.331375,133.796875,7.4655,what they manufacture has got to be and the way it's packaged has got to take that into consideration,1,0
sw2730A-ms98-a,27,A,212.930625,227.530875,14.60025,indeed well you know there's got to be a fortune in that you know i've got all we've got to do is get together and figure out some way to to use these diapers in some useful product you know some some some,1,0
sw2730A-ms98-a,47,A,329.986375,338.714875,8.7285,well something's got to be done i tell you what i was just watching a a show the other night on on Antarctica uh,1,0
sw2730A-ms98-a,60,A,443.341,451.4945,8.1535,damage the the the environment you know i think that it would be a plus for them and more people would buy more of those products,1,0
sw2730B-ms98-a,13,B,103.657,112.987375,9.330375,uh exterior fixtures which you know wouldn't be hassle to drive to or carry stuff to you know that that's kind of one of the thoughts that i had about it,1,0
sw2730B-ms98-a,68,B,450.652375,461.745,11.092625,oh boy there there's such a higher level of consciousness about that now that's that's got to be i mean if you could come up with something like that just to the the marketing advantage would be phenomenal  ,2,0
sw2730B-ms98-a,75,B,502.8355,506.58575,3.75025,i- i tend to agree and it sure would be nice to see something like that,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,5,A,8,13.1255,5.1255,uh i agree there should be some control but uh how strong of uh a control do you think there ought to be,2,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,19,A,97.038375,107.619875,10.5815,so i think that ought to be uh tightened up i favor uh uh holding uh the guns say for for seven days or whatever until uh you can check out whether somebody is legitimate or not,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,21,A,108.7945,119.652,10.8575,and i think that might stop some of the uh impulsive crimes but uh things that like that are planned uh selling guns to New York City things of that nature i don't think you're ever going to be able to stop that,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,32,A,174.92075,189.846375,14.925625,yeah i don't see any problem with owning a gun for self protection but uh education is is a big part of that people need to be educated on how to uh how to how to store their weapons uh so the kids can't get at them and so they're not a threat to the rest of the family,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,39,A,220.8145,228.444875,7.630375,so uh it's going to be really tough to uh add uh gun control type of laws to what we already have,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,56,A,368.828875,380.34625,11.517375,i think it depends on uh who's leading the crusade and how strong they feel about it take for instance Mothers Against Drunk Driving that used to be just a very small organization started by a housewife,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,63,A,413.64075,419.42975,5.789,because uh they're liable anybody who serves anything to anybody is liable can be sued,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,65,A,421.05525,423.378,2.32275,with guns i think it ought to be the same way,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,66,A,423.378,427.8805,4.5025,i think people who own guns ought to be held responsible for things that happen with those weapons,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,71,A,465.343125,471.07675,5.733625,and apparently no charges were filed against the owner of the gun who happened to be a police officer ,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,75,A,486.39525,489.389,2.99375,but somebody's got to be uh um,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,76,A,489.389,491.673125,2.284125,somebody's got to be held responsible,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,79,A,494.724875,502.1065,7.381625,so i don't know i think the law should be tightened up on on gun ownership but i can't see a total ban on it at all uh,1,0
sw2731A-ms98-a,88,A,562.527875,571.589,9.061125,well i've heard it said that that's one of the reasons why we're not as much a threat to be attacked by other countries because everybody and his brother's got a gun at home,1,0
sw2731B-ms98-a,3,B,2.9465,7.6865,4.74,i have pretty strong feelings about it yeah i think that guns ought to be controlled,1,0
sw2731B-ms98-a,16,B,64.777875,72.659,7.881125,that's i mean the other problem is there's so many guns out there if you ban sales of guns right now there'd still be millions and millions and millions of them_1,1,0
sw2731B-ms98-a,18,B,74.11525,82.929875,8.814625,would it would really be nice to make it a little harder to get one so that every punk in the world doesn't doesn't pack a rod,1,0
sw2731B-ms98-a,27,B,123.801125,132.81325,9.012125,yeah i think i think that you're right it would be the pretty much the same problem that that prohibition  is   pretty much the same problem that drug control is,1,0
sw2732A-ms98-a,113,A,510.313625,512.6565,2.342875,it's going to be  more rapid i guess,1,0
sw2732B-ms98-a,39,B,172.23,181.772375,9.542375,uh with all that uh we never seem to be able to get our house in order when it comes to the economic things i- i bring this back to that at least uh it seems like we still continue to run uh,1,0
sw2732B-ms98-a,55,B,260.684,267.835125,7.151125,yeah in my my family i know most of us are Southerners just happen to be living up in Maryland though but my family uh we're,1,0
sw2732B-ms98-a,57,B,272.639,279.45775,6.81875,and i think that may not be the norm for s- a lot of people as much as it is for us that don't want to do that,1,0
sw2732B-ms98-a,86,B,483.825125,492.13875,8.313625,uh because it's uh somewhat labor intensive even if they start robotizing it uh i- i- i i'm concerned that that would be the case instead the more,1,0
sw2732B-ms98-a,87,B,492.13875,501.838375,9.699625,uh advanced nations would tend to get more computerized more telecommunication oriented and the like and information is is getting to be uh sort of the thing,1,0
sw2732B-ms98-a,98,B,589.2345,599.785875,10.551375,i think that it should be required in college in a in a uh uh science curriculum i even think in liberal arts this day and time it should be required you have to have a year of some sort of co-,2,0
sw2733A-ms98-a,37,A,186.81025,195.69775,8.8875, but once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them_1  all of them_1 you know  it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for  ,1,0
sw2733A-ms98-a,95,A,463.111125,465.99075,2.879625,i think that'd be a good idea,1,0
sw2733B-ms98-a,10,B,72.362125,84.785625,12.4235,and we bought automobiles and all that and it was almost like and a Chevrolet dealer was our friend and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a but a Chevrolet it'd be like going and spitting on his grave  but uh,1,0
sw2733B-ms98-a,38,B,196.32325,210.135875,13.812625,and i'm afraid we're gonna be in that in another year with all of ours you know we got three eighty sixes and an eighty  and we'll probably be there with all of them_1 you know it's the same thing you know i don't know whether you uh classify the Skylark and the Calais as small i guess they're intermediates,2,0
sw2733B-ms98-a,53,B,308.57325,318.16225,9.589,and uh uh we went to uh Austin a while back to a basketball tournament and we were gonna be meeting some of my wife's relatives down there so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down we'd rent,1,0
sw2734A-ms98-a,14,A,74.8865,79.660625,4.774125,i think i agree but i think it ought to be expanded to include children,1,0
sw2734A-ms98-a,40,A,212.998875,225.29125,12.292375,it's easier to say it on the telephone and everyone agree that yeah the death penalty's the way to go it's a deterrent to crime they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway but to be the actual one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me,2,0
sw2734A-ms98-a,52,A,283.194375,292.489125,9.29475,yeah i agree it should be in effect also i agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement uh so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect but i want,3,0
sw2734A-ms98-a,60,A,334.923875,337.739375,2.8155,can be sentenced to the death sentence,1,0
sw2734A-ms98-a,76,A,383.63,386.9785,3.3485,i i think it certainly should be one of the options,1,0
sw2734B-ms98-a,23,B,117.158,121.094875,3.936875,well i don't either but uh uh but there is something to be said about,1,0
sw2734B-ms98-a,39,B,191.937,196.646875,4.709875,why should they be sitt- sitting in uh prison getting their college degree,1,0
sw2734B-ms98-a,45,B,238.57325,243.219,4.64575,uh-huh well i myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that,1,0
sw2734B-ms98-a,55,B,278.362875,283.19125,4.828375,well anyhow i guess we both agree that that it is it should be in effect,1,0
sw2734B-ms98-a,60,B,320.53675,327.01075,6.474,uh yes i'm inclined to agree with you i think so there should be a limit as to the number of appeals,1,0
sw2734B-ms98-a,103,B,485.110125,489.361125,4.251,yes it is i and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by,1,0
sw2734B-ms98-a,130,B,591.855375,596.84275,4.987375,and uh that that's gets to be uh a deterrent,1,0
sw2735A-ms98-a,25,A,114.264375,117.87675,3.612375,i yeah i think that should be regulated,1,0
sw2735B-ms98-a,33,B,108.093125,115.785625,7.6925,somebody's who's into into shooting though like you say sharpshooters or uh that type of thing wouldn't be so bad but uh,1,0
sw2735B-ms98-a,84,B,268.705625,277.52625,8.820625,they should be kept there and overcrowding of course that has a lot to do with i think a lot of times with uh the type of sentence that's given,1,0
sw2735B-ms98-a,103,B,326.676625,334.544375,7.86775,well some people have no sense at all in shooting  to know how far to be away from buildings and that to shoot i mean,1,0
sw2735B-ms98-a,135,B,440.38325,449.118125,8.734875,it would be just like uh going hunting you don't need a permit to carry you know you're not allowed to carry them loaded or anything like that,1,0
sw2735B-ms98-a,154,B,522.85075,528.158,5.30725,ten ten would be no regulations at all let's see no wait how was it,1,0
sw2736A-ms98-a,38,A,218.8805,224.538125,5.657625,yeah i think that's getting to be kind of important now that uh you know the price is becoming,1,0
sw2736A-ms98-a,55,A,291.865375,296.5275,4.662125,uh two fourteen year olds will be uh fifteen on the fourth of July,1,0
sw2736A-ms98-a,59,A,308.277625,315.183875,6.90625,so uh uh i've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be,1,0
sw2736A-ms98-a,92,A,481.1005,492.540625,11.440125,the the next car's going to be now as long as they aren't changing the model you know like when the uh Pontiac Grand Prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems with the smaller car as long as they aren't,1,0
sw2736B-ms98-a,42,B,167.112125,180.212375,13.10025,th- that would be real good for us uh my husband and i uh like to go camping and stuff and right now we have a van which is it's an older van and we're we're thinking about buying another sedan,1,0
sw2736B-ms98-a,56,B,239.687875,245.289375,5.6015,yeah well i think it's going to be a lot easier now i just heard that they  lowered the prime lending rate,1,0
sw2736B-ms98-a,57,B,245.289375,250.766375,5.477,so i think it's going to be a lot easier to to be able to get a car now and finance it,2,0
sw2736B-ms98-a,58,B,250.766375,254.495625,3.72925,i think banks are going to be a lot more a little bit more lenient,1,0
sw2736B-ms98-a,82,B,376.04175,385.1645,9.12275,so they're saying they're not as safe as they give the appearance of being safe but they're really not as safe as they as they uh appear to be,1,0
sw2736B-ms98-a,95,B,432.58975,440.704625,8.114875,so that that that's a concern of mine as far as uh what i'll be looking at w- with buying a new car um,1,0
sw2737A-ms98-a,10,A,22.050625,31.34175,9.291125,i just uh haven't taken the time to learn the fundamentals of the game i just go out and try to be Joe Athlete and think that i can just,1,0
sw2737A-ms98-a,106,A,473.3385,480.728625,7.390125,the local junior college has a golf course because it used to be an Air Force base so they've got the old Air Force base golf course and it's like,1,0
sw2737A-ms98-a,113,A,513.413125,515.894875,2.48175,well if it's genetic you'd better be careful,1,0
sw2737B-ms98-a,19,B,57.137625,69.197375,12.05975,six weeks i guess worth of golf lessons and and i had a terrible time trying to remember uh where your hands are supposed to be and over this way and under that way and keep your legs this way and it was,1,0
sw2737B-ms98-a,47,B,232.285375,247.277125,14.99175,i mean gee whiz i all i remember was we had tornadoes about the same time and that was the big highlight they were afraid they were going to go down through the center of the the the golf course        about that uh but i do remember thinking it was a lot different to be out there,1,0
sw2738A-ms98-a,21,A,134.9915,148.21675,13.22525,i consider that to be the invasion of privacy particularly when i'm sitting down at the dinner table and they give me a call and i- i have to answer this phone to find out they're trying to sell me something and my dinner's getting cold ,1,0
sw2738A-ms98-a,52,A,380.4975,395.195625,14.698125,uh you're a prime candidate to be living in a rich house and uh and spend money on foolish things so uh that gets you on a mailing list for Jaguars and Rolls Royces and things like  ,1,0
sw2738A-ms98-a,68,A,496.747625,504.490625,7.743,yeah well i had it done just to make sure that there wasn't any wrong information in there everything seemed to be all right,1,0
sw2738B-ms98-a,3,B,15.060625,29.499875,14.43925,where they just you know go through the list and whenever you pick up the phone it's a recording and there  you're supposed to hold on for a very important phone call and i feel that if it was so important that they would uh be there instead of putting me on hold ,1,0
sw2738B-ms98-a,21,B,147.16,156.6445,9.4845,right right that seems to be the prime time they call is is definitely well between uh six and eight o'clock i guess,1,0
sw2738B-ms98-a,29,B,183.999,192.607875,8.608875,right i'm surprised they don't though  uh i but i'm sure if they did that uh there would be a lot more uh,1,0
sw2738B-ms98-a,52,B,319.451875,327.493625,8.04175,so it was like okay now wait a second here so it'll be interesting to see how that works out how messed up things will be,2,0
sw2738B-ms98-a,67,B,392.997875,407.28625,14.288375, yeah we're in one of those counties and uh it uh you get lots of interesting things in the mail in Fort Bend County in southwest Houston the it seems to be the the up gro- you know the uh,1,0
sw2738B-ms98-a,70,B,427.998,441.53025,13.53225,and so uh but yeah i do you know you brought a good point about the um credit histories the credit reports that uh i feel is an can be an invasion of privacy if it's used wrong,1,0
sw2738B-ms98-a,71,B,441.53025,443.692875,2.162625,and uh should be so,1,0
sw2739A-ms98-a,9,A,38.398125,42.77825,4.380125,um not only be uh mother,1,0
sw2739A-ms98-a,17,A,59.667625,66.006,6.338375,has a lot of effect on a family and it can be positive and it can be very negative,2,0
sw2739A-ms98-a,21,A,81.398,87.38625,5.98825,uh juvenile delinquency whatever probably can be laid right at that ,1,0
sw2739A-ms98-a,27,A,108.82575,113.954,5.12825,what would it be uh uh calming   ,1,0
sw2739A-ms98-a,52,A,254.169,256.624125,2.455125,be a mother but i think that's possible,1,0
sw2739A-ms98-a,54,A,262.691,267.03825,4.34725,and any  anyplace you are you can educate be educated ,1,0
sw2739A-ms98-a,62,A,294.846625,297.728,2.881375,yeah i think that's right i think that would be good,1,0
sw2739A-ms98-a,64,A,298.994,309.461875,10.467875,right and have and have and and if if anybody is going to help them decide about uh about day care or something maybe it needs to be something worked out in uh in uh,1,0

sw2742B-ms98-a,76,B,396.387375,404.79625,8.408875,if you cut back to start with you you know you'll find you'll be surprised at how easy it is to you know if you start off saving and just continue to do that,1,0
sw2743A-ms98-a,18,A,81.308625,92.039625,10.731,took it back and  um the people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be and i fell for it and uh when i got this one,1,0
sw2743B-ms98-a,19,B,99.555125,110.44725,10.892125,huh so either you or your husband can be warm but not both ,1,0

sw2744A-ms98-a,103,A,365.0335,372.72225,7.68875,i mean that's the point we all should be at if you like finding some solution i mean you know nothing totally radical but if it's something that,1,0
sw2744A-ms98-a,129,A,463.199375,474.01425,10.814875,but um yeah there's definitely problems it's just the solutions that you know they're going to be in our political system they're going to be on everyone's minds for quite a while too long,2,0
sw2744B-ms98-a,30,B,131.328125,136.416,5.087875,well ye- that would be that'd be at the absolute most and uh,2,0
sw2744B-ms98-a,73,B,304.816125,316.876625,12.0605,uh my attitude was kind of one of you know these people are you know taking a tremendous amount of my time you know and i've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again,1,0
sw2744B-ms98-a,74,B,316.876625,324.559625,7.683,i guess today that would be uh somehow or rather there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing but,2,0
sw2744B-ms98-a,88,B,374.38625,383.493375,9.107125,well you know the the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable there are kids families that should just simply be taken out of the homes,1,0
sw2744B-ms98-a,94,B,418.656125,426.95375,8.297625,well  that's get to be a problem in Texas you know because different school systems have got m- more or less money to take care of that sort of thing you've got counselors and,1,0
sw2744B-ms98-a,117,B,502.194375,509.81375,7.619375,influence of school most of them_1 would say you know those people should be removed from the school system and in Japan they would be you know,2,0
sw2746A-ms98-a,37,A,177.8745,186.134375,8.259875,you know it's it's it's just doesn't make sense to be house poor in these economic times you know what i mean ,1,0
sw2746A-ms98-a,39,A,187.6325,191.203,3.5705,it seems to be yeah it seems to be um,2,0

sw2746A-ms98-a,74,A,354.987875,364.433875,9.446,i guess he's uh in his early eighties now and uh he's still you know very active and uh but you know the hand's just not as steady as it used to be,1,0
sw2746A-ms98-a,105,A,501.541625,508.05,6.508375,you can uh i mean it can really be your home because you've put your touch on it you know,1,0
sw2746B-ms98-a,112,B,499.6005,501.945875,2.345375,seems to be a lot of that,1,0
sw2747A-ms98-a,52,A,331.662875,336.244375,4.5815,uh would used to be Brown University now it's uh University of Rhode Island,1,0
sw2747A-ms98-a,72,A,482.5065,487.13825,4.63175,there could be the one up here some place i'm not really sure um,1,0
sw2747B-ms98-a,8,B,57.32175,69.42775,12.106,we got these uh paper sacks to put uh lawn debris and stuff in supposedly uh you know it can all be mulched at once the paper sack and everything,1,0
sw2747B-ms98-a,15,B,88.2385,97.375,9.1365,the local folks you know they're just starting to use them_1 now that the grass is starting to you know be cut and everything we're getting a lot of complaints about them_1 but,1,0
sw2747B-ms98-a,93,B,505.2415,507.92725,2.68575,that can be a real ,1,0
sw2747B-ms98-a,104,B,567.038375,579.42175,12.383375,we've got a statistic down here that they like to use you know you can take the population of the world and pack it in the state of Texas about the density of Houston and then you'd have the rest of the world to grow crops in because there wouldn't be any people in it,1,0
sw2748A-ms98-a,21,A,181.04775,183.355,2.30725,oh exterior that long that would be,1,0
sw2748A-ms98-a,88,A,576.068875,584.562875,8.494,no i i'm happy with it but i just don't do it very often or very much because it's so time consuming and because i am tend to be a perfectionist about it,1,0
sw2748B-ms98-a,19,B,103.43775,116.10525,12.6675,it's being used as a recreation center  it's uh it's con- either a matter of constantly touching up or maybe putting something more durable that i can wipe down and doesn't have to be painted all the time,1,0
sw2748B-ms98-a,22,B,125.939625,138.96175,13.022125,and that has seemed to work pretty well upstairs you know with with kids so it's uh you know it doesn't require that every year the house has to be repainted which usually i guess most people must paint about every two years,1,0
sw2748B-ms98-a,30,B,211.68675,221.979375,10.292625,uh yeah trim yeah the aluminum doesn't need to be painted but yeah the trim and most people were doing it last year for the first time and that was five years,1,0
sw2748B-ms98-a,33,B,244.179,256.4025,12.2235,and uh maybe in a older plastered house this wouldn't uh this would be too often but i think i think with the drywall they use now the plaster board really seems to soak in the paint,1,0
sw2748B-ms98-a,34,B,256.4025,261.411125,5.008625,so i'm not i'm not sure two years would be too often i don't want to do it that oft- ,1,0
sw2748B-ms98-a,44,B,296.929,309.319625,12.390625,what uh the the work that i've done that's one reason i do it uh if if i really felt that it was going to be a sloppy job and i was sorry you afterward the way it looks i wouldn't attempt to take it on but,1,0
sw2748B-ms98-a,48,B,333.174875,345.268625,12.09375,it it really makes a nice neat job You know you let the paint dry for about a half an hour an hour and peel it off and it's a perfect clean line and and i've found that it can also be used,1,0
sw2748B-ms98-a,62,B,461.1815,473.676,12.4945,and they're not as  you don't get drips as well you can get drips you have to be a little careful but they hold quite a bit of paint so i found you're not constantly dipping like with a brush,1,0
sw2748B-ms98-a,73,B,537.119125,550.7885,13.669375,you have to put a minimal amount of paint on there you probably aren't going to be able to cover as much of a surface as you would if you're doing it on a wall because if it drips you can just sort of smooth it all out uh,1,0
sw2748B-ms98-a,74,B,550.7885,563.818875,13.030375,and i haven't tried that but that's an idea because i find that ceilings are really difficult in terms of how you have to be positioned to do them and your arms are up so  it's tiring uh,1,0
sw2749A-ms98-a,2,A,1.560875,9.259875,7.699,well um i don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the uh jury system do you,1,0
sw2749A-ms98-a,11,A,56.758625,61.052625,4.294,then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt but if there are some people who don't agree,1,0
sw2749A-ms98-a,12,A,61.052625,66.271625,5.219,um then there must be it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people,3,0
sw2749A-ms98-a,23,A,154.017125,161.819,7.801875,and put up for a jury i wouldn't feel that uh i would be being tried by a jury of my peers i'd be i mean i'd be tried by a jury of,3,0
sw2749A-ms98-a,38,A,260.539125,269.7795,9.240375,oh i don't know show the show the mugging victim you know show what the nice person he was and what a family life and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim,1,0
sw2749A-ms98-a,40,A,284.308625,295.4735,11.164875,so not i i mean i'm the problem is i can't guarantee that a ju- judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury but i'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree,3,0
sw2749A-ms98-a,41,A,295.4735,298.330875,2.857375,on what the settlements would be on things like that,1,0
sw2749A-ms98-a,54,A,358.165125,371.445375,13.28025,oh of course it's it's political maneuvering the the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will you know want to hang everyone and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic they're not looking for someone whose going to be the most reasoned,1,0
sw2749A-ms98-a,55,A,371.445375,382.71875,11.273375,or sensible or rational juror neither side wants that they want to find a juror that's going to uh be most persuadable by their arguments you you know ,1,0
sw2749A-ms98-a,60,A,414.647625,419.755,5.107375,right course they'd be they would be barred but ,2,0
sw2749B-ms98-a,8,B,27.740125,36.534125,8.794,the sys- the system right now you know should you know is fine i think it should be by a jury i don't think the judge should have i mean he's just there,1,0
sw2749B-ms98-a,11,B,40.475125,44.695375,4.22025,i don't i don't even think that it should be unanimous either um,1,0
sw2749B-ms98-a,83,B,407.807125,415.27375,7.466625,you know if it was if it was a a family member of theirs though that was innocent and then they'd want to be on that jury,1,0
sw2749B-ms98-a,91,B,431.529375,438.604625,7.07525,yeah i would love to be ca- i'm ready to go  they just haven't called me up yet  ,1,0
sw2750A-ms98-a,2,A,2.972625,16.92775,13.955125,well we uh uh this will be uh uh the reunion for not my grandfather but my great grandfather and then my great and then my grandfathers so it's a couple of generations,1,0
sw2750A-ms98-a,9,A,48.625,61.994375,13.369375,uh they will not everyone won't be there for the whole time but the families can come in during that eight day time and kind of meet on the on the living family level,1,0
sw2750A-ms98-a,12,A,79.298125,87.801375,8.50325,and then uh toward the end of the week there will be two specific days when we honor these two uh,1,0
sw2750A-ms98-a,22,A,135.5475,144.618875,9.071375,so it has to be pretty fun too i think uh we're we're going uh going to Utah to uh uh place near Park City,1,0
sw2750A-ms98-a,23,A,144.618875,152.777125,8.15825,and uh and it's a a pretty good size area where there'll be hiking and and then there will be uh,2,0
sw2750A-ms98-a,34,A,232.4305,241.006,8.5755,uh could be more of a vacation situation for families to come and participate in while getting to know their ancestors and relatives,1,0
sw2750A-ms98-a,35,A,241.006,245.445375,4.439375,uh so that maybe they'd be attracted more to bring their families,1,0
sw2750A-ms98-a,36,A,245.445375,259.162,13.716625,now i've never gotten all my family to come before but this year i have uh several married daughters and and sons whose families are coming en masse so it it it looks to be a lot more interesting activity,1,0
sw2750A-ms98-a,46,A,323.336125,328.524875,5.18875,whether we'll be able to do it there again but there are other kind of arrangements like in in uh,1,0
sw2750A-ms98-a,54,A,378.64175,387.899875,9.258125,uh i think you need to plan on you need to be sure and plan uh at least a year ahead of time or you're going to lose people,1,0
sw2750A-ms98-a,68,A,467.426875,472.5105,5.083625,so it's it's really neat to be able to get acquaint- get around with them you know,1,0
sw2750B-ms98-a,82,B,530.4555,540.35,9.8945,well they try to involve me and if i allow myself to be involved you know i'll fit into the picture but uh they uh they make a big deal out of everything,1,0
sw2751B-ms98-a,4,B,14.995875,25.916,10.920125,um i would be more selective in the dealership that i purchased it from but as far as uh the quality seems to be there um it's quiet it's it handles well um,2,0
sw2751B-ms98-a,9,B,36.64125,38.465125,1.823875,and why would that be,1,0

sw2766A-ms98-a,7,A,14.034125,16.849375,2.81525,the Middle East crisis should we be there,1,0
sw2766A-ms98-a,56,A,237.10775,248.79125,11.6835,guys that was on the jury they were asking him if if you could believe a lawyer or if a lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed,1,0
sw2766B-ms98-a,10,B,22.044,35.54725,13.50325,uh you know i really i have a son that's sixteen and i think you know eventually you know he'll be of of drafting age and i think oh gosh do i want him to go and yet i'm proud to be an American and i know that we have a ,2,0
sw2766B-ms98-a,11,B,35.54725,50.211,14.66375,a country that you know people would give anything to live in a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have and yet i don't know whether i'd be willing to give his life for for this country and yet,1,0
sw2766B-ms98-a,51,B,210.136125,224.97775,14.841625,and i you know i think that if we did know i think there would be a a lot more chaos than there is because i don't i don't think people could handle it so i think there are things that we should not know that the masses shouldn't know but i also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too ,1,0
sw2766B-ms98-a,103,B,507.58,517.184625,9.604625,hum yeah  see and that's another question you have to ask is this our job is are we should we still be there even you know,1,0
sw2767A-ms98-a,39,A,131.202625,135.172375,3.96975,and you know she should be more technical for what she does,1,0
sw2767A-ms98-a,89,A,295.62675,301.06575,5.439,right right which could be you know partial partially cultural anyway,1,0
sw2767A-ms98-a,91,A,302.28225,315.23225,12.95,so that it might be circularly being the same problem of of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway so why spend your time getting qualified,1,0
sw2767A-ms98-a,97,A,339.53825,344.038625,4.500375,kids or kid i'm not sure to school in the morning and be home,1,0
sw2767A-ms98-a,118,A,429.979125,436.311375,6.33225,yeah i mean i think that would be it would it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for,1,0
sw2767A-ms98-a,141,A,515.5625,521.97425,6.41175,so then i'm uh uh probably a poor example although you know i was an administrator and could still be i suppose,1,0
sw2767A-ms98-a,145,A,528.63475,531.9495,3.31475,you were you were more ambitious than they would let you be,1,0
sw2767A-ms98-a,159,A,582.96875,594.775,11.80625,so i- i figure you know nobody must uh nobody must like it it must be a rotten job for everybody  but i know some people thrive on it ,1,0
sw2767B-ms98-a,59,B,226.07975,229.749125,3.669375,quite an well i think there are more than there used to be,1,0
sw2767B-ms98-a,82,B,300.347,302.65825,2.31125,that could be that's true,1,0
sw2767B-ms98-a,133,B,481.151875,488.626375,7.4745,i think maybe more men would like to be if they  weren't put down so badly ,1,0
sw2768A-ms98-a,5,A,22.576625,27.230625,4.654,in some sort of home the first thing that i would look at would be their history,1,0
sw2768A-ms98-a,55,A,163.009375,169.293375,6.284,anyone is in a home like that and my biggest fear would that they would be is that they would be lonely,2,0
sw2768A-ms98-a,82,A,263.48125,270.29275,6.8115,that is great for that that will be something you know they would look forward to if they knew that you know that the puppy is coming on Wednesday,1,0
sw2768A-ms98-a,83,A,270.29275,273.661875,3.369125,you know that would be something to look for that's really neat that really is,1,0
sw2768A-ms98-a,94,A,293.915625,299.0195,5.103875,home to me would be a ve-  the very last resort you know it,1,0
sw2768A-ms98-a,96,A,307.9865,312.08725,4.10075,to to because an elderly person sometimes can be,1,0
sw2768A-ms98-a,97,A,312.08725,321.130875,9.043625,totally dependent you know on you and i know that's hard sometimes and but it would really have to be a last resort because that would just i- i would feel so guilty,1,0
sw2768A-ms98-a,131,A,406.476125,408.739,2.262875,like i i would really like to be a teacher,1,0
sw2768A-ms98-a,140,A,448.4215,452.697625,4.276125,you know and all they want is just for everything to be happy and you know,1,0
sw2768A-ms98-a,162,A,503.812875,512.374875,8.562,they like to uh share their experiences with the younger children they'll be telling them all kinds of stories that they don't even know what they mean but,1,0
sw2768A-ms98-a,163,A,512.374875,517.71025,5.335375,you know they feel like they've lived life so they need to share it and i'm sure i'll be like that too,1,0
sw2768B-ms98-a,25,B,137.50275,149.430625,11.927875,they got like several new color TV's for the people and and redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more interesting place for them to be they made a little patio area where they can go outside and,1,0
sw2768B-ms98-a,63,B,277.514,283.027375,5.513375,yeah it there's a lot that can be done it's just a matter of people not being lazy,1,0
sw2768B-ms98-a,64,B,283.027375,290.504625,7.47725,and you know doing the best they can but again i don't know what i'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother you know uh that would be,1,0
sw2768B-ms98-a,86,B,375.13275,384.56175,9.429,and um he's blind and he's um  has seizures you know i mean he's just he's like in a world of his own and yet he wants so much to be around people,1,0
sw2768B-ms98-a,139,B,533.810625,535.34075,1.530125,would be a last resort,1,0
sw2769A-ms98-a,76,A,304.3985,312.031125,7.632625,they're opening up a new restaurant in about a month uh in Keystone called Razzoo's it's going to be a Cajun restaurant,1,0
sw2769A-ms98-a,79,A,315.841375,319.5175,3.676125, Flamingo used to be the Cactus before that,1,0
sw2769B-ms98-a,91,B,271.62575,278.362125,6.736375,yeah well i don't know Wendy's i think Wendy's tries to be more of a homemade burger so,1,0
sw2770A-ms98-a,25,A,134.88275,147.893625,13.010875,and i i'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog i'm like i know it'll be fun the first week maybe and then mom gets to     or something so i gue-,1,0
sw2770B-ms98-a,21,B,90.203,101.42825,11.22525,it was well yeah i don't i don't care for the smell of a litter box so my cat was trained to go outside other than that it was inside when it wanted to be it was outside when you know it,1,0
sw2770B-ms98-a,39,B,186.92375,196.1635,9.23975,well if you're if you're gonna have a pet and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to you know deal with the consequences take care of the offspring and,1,0
sw2770B-ms98-a,42,B,214.03875,222.69225,8.6535,you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road you know they're they're they're getting old now and it's time to get rid of them_1 so,1,0
sw2771A-ms98-a,19,A,93.0805,98.903,5.8225,it's the things that we're not doing that we should be doing like right now there's a big outbreak of uh,1,0
sw2771A-ms98-a,21,A,109.84875,116.33175,6.483,and it looks like it's going to be a pretty serious uh thing there they're talking about it lasting for ten years,1,0
sw2771A-ms98-a,90,A,577.64975,585.202875,7.553125,i don't know if it's intentional on the part of you know the the powers that be or whether no body really cares,1,0
sw2771B-ms98-a,19,B,115.25625,121.97375,6.7175,yeah i heard about that that's supposed to be kind of sweeping on up through the uh Central Ameri- American countries too,1,0
sw2771B-ms98-a,57,B,278.214125,285.480375,7.26625,but yet he let's them_1 each be a free enterprise uh uh person but they work together in terms of what they organize to grow,1,0
sw2771B-ms98-a,58,B,285.480375,299.437125,13.95675,and they grow massive amounts of things that are common to each other in certain areas and yet they vary their crops in such a way that they they uh can be very productive in how ma- much of these crops they make but they can also roll them_1 over,1,0
sw2771B-ms98-a,63,B,321.844,332.29425,10.45025,and so uh this guy may be actually going to finely turn the uh the country on i mean it's always been tough for the southern or or lower latitude countries ,1,0
sw2771B-ms98-a,64,B,332.29425,336.559,4.26475,to be as productive as some reason another and as the higher latitude countries,1,0
sw2771B-ms98-a,86,B,413.902875,419.76875,5.865875,i don't know that that they don't seem to be able to keep any particular stable regime for any particular long period of time,1,0
sw2771B-ms98-a,100,B,475.650125,488.6,12.949875,could it possibly be because of they're they're little third world countries and they are all independent from one another where as if they had of somehow or another from their past history formed into a larger country like our continental United States did,1,0
sw2772A-ms98-a,90,A,407.371625,411.927875,4.55625,for instance it'd be or east Texas is a little more humid,1,0
sw2772B-ms98-a,76,B,364.45975,378.71575,14.256,except and then in the the winter and then it seems  sort of like a San Antonio um early winter or fall year round so it seems like we only have two springs which is or two seasons and that would be spring and fall and we never really get any of the other ones ,1,0
sw2772B-ms98-a,92,B,474.004625,487.3555,13.350875,uh-huh it does and the um the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region but um but we like it so it's a nice change so we'll be here a couple of years and we thought well we'll take advantage of it and and see what all the Pacific coast is like ,1,0
sw2773A-ms98-a,51,A,316.801875,326.71225,9.910375,um-hum well do you think the US should even be involved i mean as as the world leader in the sense trying to resolve the issues or should we have just stayed out of it,1,0
sw2773B-ms98-a,18,B,115.256375,127.824875,12.5685,we've just misread almost everything in that we always seem to be getting in bed with the wrong fellow for the next next tenure or next thing down the road and uh ,1,0
sw2773B-ms98-a,19,B,127.824875,137.516875,9.692,then we can and we don't seem to read Israel correctly so uh i don't know it should be a mess it's uh not going to be anything we're going to get out of very soon,2,0
sw2773B-ms98-a,25,B,166.261875,175.057625,8.79575,um i don't know be be interesting to keep watching i guess but i'm just afraid it's going it's going to break us,2,0
sw2773B-ms98-a,30,B,186.763375,200.898375,14.135,and cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand and it's uh it needs to be uh taught from the earliest grades with our school systems in such disarray i don't know if that it doesn't look terribly hopeful,1,0
sw2773B-ms98-a,39,B,237.274125,243.854125,6.58,it'll be a good topic for  in the  for a   since i teach history so,1,0
sw2773B-ms98-a,41,B,250.09325,264.388625,14.295375,well i would just think if Bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the United Nations to um,1,0
sw2773B-ms98-a,44,B,285.002125,292.50975,7.507625,tha- that becomes a different matter simply because you're dealing with Israel and and they seem to be more intractable than ever,1,0
sw2773B-ms98-a,54,B,348.57525,354.384375,5.809125,the foreseeable future as long as we can keep our head our own head above water to be the the world's leader,1,0
sw2773B-ms98-a,55,B,354.384375,366.13475,11.750375,so i Bush is probably if if he can keep that correlation together especially the French and the British and the Germans and and and be sure that the Japanese can kick in some of their money,1,0
sw2773B-ms98-a,66,B,438.234125,443.679375,5.44525,eliminate that for awhile i just don't think it's going to be too dangerous to be any place in there,2,0
sw2774A-ms98-a,33,A,184.73,197.40625,12.67625,yeah well we have a lot that needs to be done we have uh we have uh carpeting and and uh we did have a a new uh floor put in our kitchen and um,1,0
sw2775A-ms98-a,26,A,87.42975,91.700125,4.270375,most houses i would think would be sort of like uh what we live in just a,1,0
sw2775B-ms98-a,46,B,348.9225,351.97225,3.04975,i don't want to be a part of the rat race i want to be,2,0
sw2776A-ms98-a,21,A,171.358375,175.9135,4.555125,yes when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children,1,0
sw2776A-ms98-a,31,A,239.759625,249.809875,10.05025,and uh you know if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then i'll be around a lot longer,1,0
sw2776A-ms98-a,71,A,505.533625,514.6225,9.088875,uh but to to believe some of the things that they you know and i don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high high fat diet,1,0
sw2776A-ms98-a,89,A,565.92175,568.865,2.94325, they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued,1,0
sw2776B-ms98-a,95,B,457.18,465.710125,8.530125,i'll have to remember that that'd be really interesting my husband wants to go into med school and be a neurosurgeon so he's really interested in the heart,2,0
sw2777A-ms98-a,18,A,112.8705,124.4525,11.582,to what they're actually doing show them like this is what your plant is doing and we as consumers have to be prepared to pay a higher cost for the product,1,0
sw2777A-ms98-a,89,A,564.287875,569.155,4.867125,yeah it's you know maybe there'll be six inches on the ground at one time,1,0
sw2777B-ms98-a,8,B,53.0015,64.80775,11.80625,um that has to be i guess a little bit more aware of you know the output and uh harmful chemicals and things that they use um what do you think about that,1,0
sw2777B-ms98-a,25,B,213.663875,222.3515,8.687625,um really make a change and make a difference in the way people think and you're right about the education it's just got to be little by little by little,1,0
sw2777B-ms98-a,32,B,266.445375,278.1045,11.659125,and i don't know what to do about smokers because you know that's sort of an infringement of they're rights see you can go overboard too you can be real radical about this and i'm not for that i'm for,1,0
sw2777B-ms98-a,48,B,395.181125,404.108625,8.9275,like hit bottom like they either have to die or they have to be you know totally incapacitated before they change their mind and you know,1,0
sw2777B-ms98-a,54,B,440.32,445.553125,5.233125,and you know and it's not getting to be a big deal anymore i ,1,0
sw2778A-ms98-a,27,A,91.298625,101.238875,9.94025,recyclable refuse out and not to be very you know you could have cans and aluminum cans and tin cans and bottles and everything and apparently they sorted it out,1,0
sw2778A-ms98-a,41,A,179.213875,188.165875,8.952,and then you have to start using something else yeah it seems like we're using up a lot of the abundant mate- minerals right now i mean petroleum will be gone in about three decades,1,0
sw2778A-ms98-a,43,A,194.025,200.537125,6.512125,through you know more sensitivity of what the long term costs would be rather than just the extraction costs would,1,0
sw2778A-ms98-a,61,A,306.152125,310.80475,4.652625,um the problem is there's so many different types of plastic and they can't be mixed together,1,0
sw2778A-ms98-a,62,A,310.80475,317.941875,7.137125,but any one type of plastic can be recycled just about easier than anything because_1 it melts down real easily and so forth can be ,2,0
sw2778A-ms98-a,64,A,321.999875,331.82575,9.825875,um there are a number of laws about that some things can't be recycled back into the same products for health concerns even though they're not scientifically valid health concerns,1,0
sw2778A-ms98-a,66,A,336.945875,343.861625,6.91575,but and other things made to be uh can go back you know glass can go back into glass bottles and stuff,1,0
sw2778A-ms98-a,75,A,369.82775,378.18425,8.3565,yeah although there's far a lot more could be done there are just there are yards just heaped with mountains literally mountains of tires which       ,1,0
sw2778A-ms98-a,76,A,378.18425,380.856125,2.671875,so if we can do more things with those that would be helpful,1,0
sw2778A-ms98-a,86,A,421.334625,424.237125,2.9025,well that would be admirable i- i think that's wonderful,1,0
sw2778A-ms98-a,93,A,453.053,460.016125,6.963125,need to be disposed of properly just your basic ten cell batteries um once they rust out there's some pretty nasty things in them especially_1 the mercury ones,1,0
sw2778B-ms98-a,25,B,199.709,204.732625,5.023625,i guess uh i- my main concern with uh with the recycling is that we should be,1,0
sw2778B-ms98-a,30,B,237.066625,240.810875,3.74425,but uh i think there's there's got to be a better way,1,0
sw2778B-ms98-a,61,B,381.08325,390.101125,9.017875,but uh i thi- you know i think that uh that the future should be that uh home builders and you know designers and everybody should be,2,0
sw2778B-ms98-a,66,B,397.94525,407.0675,9.12225,we're uh my wife and i are are looking at you know designing a new house now and uh probably you know some years away before we'll be ready to build it but,1,0
sw2779A-ms98-a,10,A,15.120375,25.936,10.815625,well i think there's a lot to be said for that point of view i i really think that congress turned on the taps and then there were lots of people there to carry away the water,1,0
sw2779A-ms98-a,22,A,55.34775,66.013,10.66525,uh-huh i think that would've been a much smarter way to handle it and the another thing that would've helped a lot would be to make certain that  the people who were going to use the money,1,0
sw2779A-ms98-a,25,A,73.53925,82.487625,8.948375,when they can leverage just a very small investment into millions of dollars worth of tax payers money and it's turning out to be a lot more than that,1,0

sw2807A-ms98-a,17,A,37.355,44.667125,7.312125,yeah sometimes you know the the time consuming stuff can be the worst things to go for especially when you have a group of people,1,0
sw2807A-ms98-a,143,A,556.163625,564.470875,8.30725,uh and hickory chips and stuff like that in there which does give it the appearance but i just i like the i like to be able to push the starter and have it light up,1,0
sw2807B-ms98-a,66,B,225.74625,228.791375,3.045125,it's supposed to be the original one ,1,0
sw2807B-ms98-a,145,B,493.846,497.467875,3.621875,that sounds good well you must be really into cooking i'm not much into it,1,0
sw2808A-ms98-a,26,A,99.7365,109.52825,9.79175,uh but when i worked i tended to uh be confused a lot at first and tr- i would get things out of the closet and,1,0
sw2808A-ms98-a,47,A,243.31875,254.21425,10.8955,and uh purple and hot pinks well very often those can be comb- combined and navy blues and whites,1,0
sw2808A-ms98-a,97,A,452.780625,459.846,7.065375,uh they really pretty much needed to be uh they need to look good with uh,1,0
sw2808A-ms98-a,105,A,482.48875,487.86725,5.3785,and i hope uh it would be nice i'm getting to talk to some of the same people,1,0
sw2808B-ms98-a,5,B,21.42375,29.84175,8.418,i consider a full-time college student i don't consider it really a job but i guess in a way it would be  i never really thought about it,1,0
sw2808B-ms98-a,98,B,473.986625,478.767875,4.78125,yeah that would just be too much  oh gosh,1,0
sw2809A-ms98-a,15,A,90.78,104.58225,13.80225,but until that happens be- between now and then there's a lot of other uh events that could happen including a resurgence of communism with uh violent uh backlash against democracy,1,0
sw2809A-ms98-a,16,A,104.58225,108.24575,3.6635,wh- which is where we could be in threatened i guess you'd say,1,0
sw2809A-ms98-a,39,A,177.471375,190.0485,12.577125,the um well one thing that's cu- of interest is is if the Soviet Union's structure does break down and there is civil war at the end of those civil wars or during those civil wars in whose hands will those missiles be,1,0
sw2809A-ms98-a,55,A,251.01525,256.41,5.39475,oh well so that's uh  what's going to be real interesting is if when they have the next presidential elections,1,0
sw2809A-ms98-a,57,A,259.090125,267.636125,8.546,or if he's    with someone else which i think would be uh i wonder if that's if there's precedent for that where uh there's uh same president but a different vice president,1,0
sw2809B-ms98-a,4,B,24.730625,37.991375,13.26075,yeah well i mean that's that's certainly true i guess i'm i'm confused uh by what it means to be a threat to the United States and so i'm not sure i even recognize the United States as anything to be threatened um,2,0
sw2809B-ms98-a,6,B,45.597125,52.615,7.017875,um and it would certainly be nice if the various um republics seceded,1,0
sw2809B-ms98-a,7,B,52.615,60.604625,7.989625,on the other hand i also think it would be very nice if the various states in our union seceded uh but that's beside the  uh,1,0
sw2809B-ms98-a,8,B,60.604625,69.87,9.265375,and it's much less than clear to me that as a military power um there's going to be anything left uh given that anything like that happens,1,0
sw2809B-ms98-a,20,B,129.997,132.1175,2.1205,that could be that could be,2,0
sw2809B-ms98-a,24,B,142.698125,146.719,4.020875,so um you know they might be perfectly happy to sit back and wait for it to happen ,1,0
sw2809B-ms98-a,27,B,158.800375,165.948875,7.1485,and there seems to be enough people in our country who are happy to do that sort of thing because they think they'd get more out of it that way,1,0
sw2809B-ms98-a,36,B,194.1495,198.3925,4.243,that's true that's that can be a frightening thought,1,0
sw2809B-ms98-a,80,B,338.048875,340.9925,2.943625,might be used against them that's right,1,0
sw2809B-ms98-a,82,B,342.474125,351.28075,8.806625,and so i think just from that there's going to be some limited amounts of disarmament they'll still be republics with the missiles the ones that are under the firmer control of the of the Soviets,2,0
sw2810A-ms98-a,34,A,113.713375,124.253875,10.5405,you know if my neighbor next door was hungry and they needed something to eat or something to wear i'd be glad to share and so i guess in the global sense you have to have that kind of feeling to a certain extent but,1,0
sw2810A-ms98-a,38,A,141.154625,143.838,2.683375,those things have to be taught,1,0
sw2810A-ms98-a,50,A,189.9385,194.3485,4.41, in order to accommodate the extra teaching that's going to be needed,1,0
sw2810A-ms98-a,52,A,197.3925,204.241375,6.848875,they're going to th- all aids all paid aids everything is going to have to be volunteer through the parent teacher organizations,1,0
sw2810A-ms98-a,78,A,330.372625,334.971875,4.59925, and still be able to fix it at home and tote it up there and what not so,1,0
sw2810A-ms98-a,88,A,358.22175,367.867625,9.645875,and uh i think we're going to be seeing alternative calendar very soon i i'm still basically against it although i i do understand the positives,1,0
sw2810A-ms98-a,97,A,406.518375,412.246125,5.72775,been fortunate enough to be in in these extra curricular things but golly,1,0
sw2810A-ms98-a,98,A,412.246125,427.077,14.830875,you know it's just really you know it's like a smaller school system you know you could be in the drill team and you could be cheerleader too and you could be you know on the football team and still be on the basketball team and still try out for band you know ,4,0
sw2810B-ms98-a,12,B,44.721625,46.817,2.095375,yeah you shouldn't be doing,1,0
sw2811B-ms98-a,83,B,280.100375,288.89,8.789625,he always took good care of it and he bought it just to pull a boat with and when it when it got to be old and uh or older i bought it in seventy seven from him it was about six years old,1,0
sw2812A-ms98-a,40,A,128.032375,136.39775,8.365375,um like she used to be she used to be kind of kind of a a rock you know in the house yeah and uh since since everyone's ,2,0
sw2812A-ms98-a,41,A,136.39775,149.14975,12.752,going out and working now whether it be because of finances or just the economy uh the mother's not there anymore and the children are i think i think a lot of society is suffering not to say that women shouldn't,1,0
sw2812A-ms98-a,113,A,429.107,443.342625,14.235625,you know and whether i want to realize it or not everything on television is young young young young you can't be a model after thirty you can't do this after twenty you know and e- everybody that's in the music business is starting out at fifteen,1,0
sw2812B-ms98-a,14,B,48.78475,55.244,6.45925,just everybody be damned and live with someone and you know social social morals were a little bit lacking,1,0
sw2812B-ms98-a,40,B,184.886875,193.721625,8.83475,what's it like to be twenty three as a woman today i mean when i was twenty three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married um those were the general issues,1,0
sw2812B-ms98-a,48,B,215.590625,218.029125,2.4385,you didn't know what was there to be missing,1,0
sw2812B-ms98-a,80,B,365.070875,377.73125,12.660375,finally to a point where i mean i don't know why i didn't didn't do it sooner but this is probably typical of the women's movement too the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway if you want to go back to school i'm seriously considering going back to school for law,1,0
sw2812B-ms98-a,104,B,477.843,490.3075,12.4645,it's just individual choices i stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had um in my family my brother's children i mean he just turned forty his children will be out of high school before he's forty five um,1,0
sw2813B-ms98-a,23,B,121.283125,124.1035,2.820375,that would be a great opportunity,1,0
sw2813B-ms98-a,34,B,175.5775,186.961375,11.383875,uh Michener of doing that you know i read some of his early stuff and then it seemed like his later stuff they would be these long long long passages that were just of inferior quality it,1,0
sw2813B-ms98-a,36,B,189.632125,203.853875,14.22175,yeah i mean i just got the feeling that he sort of has a coterie of of students and he says okay go write three chapters on this and he and he kind of he might write some stuff i don't think he writes all his stuff every word i may be wrong,1,0
sw2813B-ms98-a,81,B,445.42375,453.2335,7.80975,with uh th- and they get some of the best s- scholars and scientists in the country to write articles that can be understood,1,0
sw2813B-ms98-a,92,B,497.5395,500.667,3.1275,oh that would be fascinating,1,0
sw2813B-ms98-a,98,B,533.916625,539.315625,5.399,i see okay that would be a very interesting thing,1,0
sw2814A-ms98-a,42,A,364.025125,372.66925,8.644125,you have to pretty much spray them_1 regularly you know under an and around or whatever so you want to leave yourself uh enough space to get under it or or be able to lift it up,1,0
sw2814A-ms98-a,54,A,438.87175,449.69925,10.8275,on those and then when he cuts them_1 and puts them_1 together then that'll already be treated and a fast way of doing that if you'll go get a piece of guttering material like a little trough,1,0
sw2814A-ms98-a,64,A,484.06125,495.778625,11.717375,but uh redwood even if you don't treat it properly will begin to discolor and will begin to degrade even though it will be strong structurally strong and and will be there for a lot longer,2,0
sw2814A-ms98-a,69,A,516.253125,528.385375,12.13225,and uh or they even have some rejuvenator that you can put on there that makes the redwood color come back but it's expensive and and and most cases if you do it properly it will not even be required,1,0
sw2814A-ms98-a,76,A,563.79025,565.667,1.87675,you would never be able to know it so,1,0
sw2814A-ms98-a,80,A,593.048625,597.07075,4.022125,well and it's and it could be cheaper in the long run and,1,0
sw2814B-ms98-a,25,B,176.945,183.039375,6.094375,i don't know i- i guess you get this idea that everything should be perfect and you know what this isn't a perfect world ,1,0
sw2814B-ms98-a,33,B,218.073375,229.792,11.718625,concerned about how it looked and and you know how it should be done the right way and he gave us a lot of clues you just wish you knew all this stuff going in that um,1,0
sw2815A-ms98-a,41,A,190.82775,193.50025,2.6725,oh that's going to be a lot of hard work though,1,0
sw2815A-ms98-a,44,A,200.372625,207.679875,7.30725,well i know everybody's throwing away millions of dollars worth of plastic and stuff everyday just to be buried,1,0
sw2815B-ms98-a,37,B,194.466,201.85975,7.39375,yes but it will be more profitable in the long run from what i understand because,1,0
sw2815B-ms98-a,45,B,252.544,263.2315,10.6875,that well it's not useless it just can't be sold as clear glass anymore back to the recycle places they say well uh you know look you already you've got and they have percentages you know,1,0
sw2815B-ms98-a,92,B,461.047,467.475875,6.428875,but i want to make up for it because i want to be real conscientious in this and that you know what i'm saying you,1,0
sw2816A-ms98-a,74,A,365.569,377.91975,12.35075,i think it's got to come through the work place where they where uh uh a parent can take a child and and maybe even have an area an isolation area where children who are ill can be there,1,0
sw2816B-ms98-a,5,B,28.439625,32.3955,3.955875,find a way of working at home so she does not have to be a away from her children,1,0
sw2816B-ms98-a,9,B,51.838375,64.41125,12.572875,ea- ea- each child is an individual and uh to be treated at a very very  age as a math and say you have to do this at a certain time you have to do this at a certain time it just wasn't working out real well,1,0
sw2816B-ms98-a,12,B,72.341625,81.38025,9.038625,uh we have had a couple of incidences that uh where child care has not turned out to be very good is it's been very very bad,1,0
sw2816B-ms98-a,49,B,303.5465,308.387,4.8405,well that's what they should that's what should be you know that that is ideal um,1,0
sw2816B-ms98-a,54,B,349.90725,364.540125,14.632875,uh it's almost impossible because you have to know somebody that will recommend some place that uh you know is going to be safe and secure i would like to see more companies uh develop them_1 right in the company,1,0
sw2817A-ms98-a,54,A,410.8925,422.74925,11.85675,nursing home and a uh you know just a a retirement village or whatever they're called those so i guess there's different levels you just have to be sure and match your loved one with that,1,0
sw2817A-ms98-a,61,A,460.514375,466.3325,5.818125,we're going to see you know geriatrics will be a a big part of the med- profession i think,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,4,B,18.02075,24.74475,6.724,uh i think that you know would definitely be preferable if the person is,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,5,B,24.74475,39.269875,14.525125,you know able t- able to do that i think sometimes people take on i know i have one friend who is taken on more than she can handle you know with her her mom just needing constant supervision and for one person to be able to cope with that you know is really,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,8,B,59.768625,69.267125,9.4985, he's getting up there but he's very difficult to live with and i think that would be a real consideration in in um entering him into our family unit here you know,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,13,B,95.640125,105.90425,10.264125,you know have like a little separate wing or something where i wouldn't have to constantly be having my children you know be quiet and go away and that kind of thing to accommodate an elderly person,2,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,14,B,105.90425,119.428875,13.524625,i think you know just the medical aspects too would be a big question how much um it would require you know in terms of nursing care at home and i know that there is uh often times insurance companies won't even pay,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,16,B,127.532875,137.781125,10.24825,that's a consideration too but i don't know it'd be it would be a really rough choice to make you know depending on the parent their personality and you know your own family and what's going on with,2,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,17,B,137.781125,147.199875,9.41875,i'm home all day anyway right now with young kids but if i was working you know full time and had to give up a career that would be another you know problem too but,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,27,B,206.04925,219.905,13.85575,obscene that was or something     gosh if i walked into a place and i saw a staff member just berating or humil- humiliating a patient i would definitely that would be something i'd really want to be on the look out for um,2,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,28,B,219.905,229.699125,9.794125,i would hope that they would have uh you know some you consistent staff i know they don't pay that much in a lot of those places and so there's probably a lot of turnover that'd be another thing that would be,2,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,29,B,229.699125,241.439,11.739875,you know something to be important because i think it's confusing particularly if people are in some state of you know mental confusion anyway to have constant new people on staff and having to develop new relationships and,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,34,B,264.734625,269.67325,4.938625,it it would really be hard because when we go to visit i'm sure that places have you know their best,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,35,B,269.67325,280.624125,10.950875,foot forward kind of thing unless you drop in frequently and kind of get the since of what's going on behind the scenes it w- really would be hard to know it's kind of similar in away to some of the things you look for in going to try and find day care for your kids,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,38,B,301.03725,311.857625,10.820375,yeah i think that would be great i- i had wished often um with my husband's grandmother that she had been in a place like that because she had lived alone in an upper story of an apartment building away from even,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,41,B,331.473625,342.552125,11.0785,so i think that would be great if if you know if i had to choose a place for myself that's definitely why i think that kind of atmosphere would be wonderful even i recall where i was living in the college dormitory as a graduate student,2,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,42,B,342.552125,355.596625,13.0445,i thought how how neat you know that you can have a place where you can you know go down together and have dinner with other people because if your living alone the isolation and the depression and all those other factors should be taken into consideration too,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,43,B,355.596625,369.314375,13.71775,so i thought you know they should have dorms for older people they had activities going on all the time    it was really a much more comfortable lifestyle i could imagine for an older person so yeah i think that would be great if they had places like that,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,57,B,429.718375,441.77925,12.060875,you know for people i know that um in that way too that sometimes the elderly can be more involved with their families they can have their grandkids or  you know that kind of thing over to spend the night or there's a lot more freedom i think ,1,0
sw2817B-ms98-a,58,B,441.77925,447.928875,6.149625,instead of just being kind of taken away from all of that and told where you're going to be and what you're going to do in a nursing home,1,0
sw2818A-ms98-a,9,A,21.77925,36.494625,14.715375,even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word uh still you have to deal with the people that you know happen to be operating it locally,1,0
sw2818A-ms98-a,33,A,133.891375,144.200875,10.3095,so um i can see where someone you know in a position like that in a live in capacity would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the finances to be able to do that,2,0
sw2818A-ms98-a,37,A,151.677875,157.917625,6.23975,you know a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way but you still have to be realistic as well i think,1,0
sw2818A-ms98-a,44,A,174.766375,186.2095,11.443125,you know it's just there's so much pressure when you're talking about uh two people that work outside the home and and i think that's one reason why i continue to be without children i,1,0
sw2818A-ms98-a,63,A,274.075625,288.197125,14.1215,it's just i can imagine how emotional it must be and and you know multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person or you're uncomfortable with the situation you've been placed in as far as child care goes um it's it's just a scary thing,1,0
sw2818A-ms98-a,81,A,328.280375,337.734625,9.45425,i think it takes a l- i- i don't know i think your patient level mu- needs to increase as the child gets older  i think that might be part of the problem with some people,1,0
sw2818A-ms98-a,101,A,405.744625,418.53325,12.788625,that's amazing it's amazing that people actually the stamina that you must you know draw from yourself to deal with it it must be interesting i guess you fi- find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought maybe,1,0
sw2818A-ms98-a,130,A,508.7035,523.270125,14.566625,i don't know i- i- i have to admit i was a self- i was selfish as a child i didn't want a brother or sister and now that i'm older of course it's different you know i think about uh wouldn't it be nice but uh anyway,1,0
sw2818B-ms98-a,5,B,8.636125,14.244625,5.6085,and what do they say about finding adequate child care i think that may be the key word,1,0
sw2818B-ms98-a,9,B,52.225375,56.82775,4.602375,well we've certainly found that to be true uh indeed we've,1,0
sw2818B-ms98-a,28,B,211.8135,213.549125,1.735625,to be a parent,1,0
sw2818B-ms98-a,31,B,218.800875,222.8855,4.084625,you know i- i just have to be honest about it it's not always worth it,1,0
sw2818B-ms98-a,32,B,222.8855,229.438375,6.552875,there are those times when i think jeez if i didn't have children i could be out playing bridge or golf,1,0
sw2818B-ms98-a,41,B,322.58425,328.406625,5.822375,the the ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers ,1,0
sw2818B-ms98-a,48,B,380.604375,386.474625,5.87025,and it has to be somewhere else and no it's not adequate to sit and wait,1,0
sw2818B-ms98-a,78,B,499.151625,504.24225,5.090625,and uh we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends,1,0
sw2819A-ms98-a,26,A,71.8975,81.445625,9.548125,yeah i- i definitely think that has gotten a lot worse and you know i i think there's to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values,1,0
sw2819A-ms98-a,34,A,91.504875,98.3095,6.804625,yeah th- i think there's more pressure like on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be and,1,0
sw2819A-ms98-a,88,A,262.048125,266.568125,4.52,yeah yeah but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back too i mean,1,0
sw2819B-ms98-a,8,B,32.369375,43.1535,10.784125,civic freedoms are more restricted but that may just be because i've changed you know i used to live up north Down here Dallas seems to me the police are militant but uh,1,0
sw2819B-ms98-a,15,B,52.76575,58.368875,5.603125,in fact in the eight years i've been here it seems to me it gets more and more gets to be more and more restrictive place to live,1,0
sw2819B-ms98-a,42,B,159.482625,163.986875,4.50425,lower class is expanding and sooner or later there's going to there's going to be a turn around,1,0
sw2819B-ms98-a,45,B,166.670625,170.19875,3.528125,but i think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class uh,1,0
sw2819B-ms98-a,48,B,173.943625,182.284,8.340375,it's hard for me to say i hope it  because i'd be one of those that gets caught but on the other hand there's a lot of injustice that needs to be be changed,3,0
sw2820A-ms98-a,30,A,120.19,121.95525,1.76525,i think that may be,1,0
sw2820A-ms98-a,31,A,121.95525,124.730875,2.775625,yeah that may be one of the points of it,1,0
sw2820A-ms98-a,33,A,138.373625,145.847375,7.47375,you know i'm saying they can't they may not be able trace don't know how far you trace i don't know what the you know limits are or whate-,1,0
sw2820A-ms98-a,103,A,346.663375,359.377,12.713625,and the stuff that happened to them you know five years ago comes up and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better you know when they might be actually trying to improve their lives you know,1,0
sw2820B-ms98-a,18,B,111.30525,122.9655,11.66025,yeah well i think it it may i mean that in in in that respect i think it may help a lot i think it may be pushing people away from hopefully push people away from drug use if they know that you know well if you use drugs you won't get this job i mean,1,0
sw2820B-ms98-a,24,B,144.250875,155.96275,11.711875,i don't know the uh that that would actually be an interesting thing to find out i think i don't i don't actually know how long those things stay in the blood in the system i've heard some you know you so some things supposedly stay for six months some stay for less some stay for longer i mean,1,0
sw2820B-ms98-a,28,B,166.41725,168.512,2.09475,i mean there must be some,1,0
sw2820B-ms98-a,51,B,289.9945,299.167625,9.173125,yeah otherwise they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping around and being fidgety and may- they say that you would sort of it can be shocking and it they want to see how easy it is shock you,1,0
sw2820B-ms98-a,66,B,365.018125,374.5175,9.499375,i'm thinking walk in and say look i did do drugs you know a year ago and i'm off them_1 for a year now and this and that and so if you ta- if i take i'll be happy to take the test but it will show up positive of course i think,1,0
sw2821A-ms98-a,99,A,387.583375,389.663125,2.07975,it'll be neat,1,0
sw2821A-ms98-a,108,A,416.225,430.338125,14.113125,you have to be careful if you go to a a restaurant that that really is more adult you know with the atmosphere and everything they if you're like we could probably take our oldest son and our oldest daughter,1,0
sw2821B-ms98-a,8,B,19.767125,28.501875,8.73475,the- then this'll probably be i mean this isn't really excellent Italian food that sounds terrible to tell you go go somewhere where it's not that great but it's um,1,0
sw2821B-ms98-a,36,B,154.015125,165.2655,11.250375,even though you have to stand in line and all that that's the only thing i don't like about it too it's a little bit with the the meat market atmosphere you know even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to um be ar- not to be around that,2,0
sw2821B-ms98-a,62,B,296.363875,305.310375,8.9465,it was yeah in fact if i could pick my um restaurants on how their coffee is and how their French bread is and the butter and the desert i would be ,1,0
sw2821B-ms98-a,63,B,305.310375,312.36725,7.056875,yes i would be in hog heaven and how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want or do you still order for them or,1,0
sw2821B-ms98-a,69,B,329.606,340.5605,10.9545,yeah everybody every child that i even know that eats vegetables um  be- below five years old still after a certain age realize that there is something called McDonald's,1,0
sw2821B-ms98-a,84,B,388.862375,396.803,7.940625,i think it'll be worth it and somebody said to me in terms of  this is food so i can say this but they said you have to bring the formula and i said what's ,1,0
sw2822A-ms98-a,16,A,71.467375,79.203875,7.7365,and you can go there and buy a kit or at least you use to be able to i'm not sure that you can still buy those from them now,1,0
sw2822A-ms98-a,67,A,304.34575,316.26875,11.923,i don't know i guess the uh the personal computer is it's really uh going to be a necessity that you know children should learn to use it i was just commenting i teach uh a couple accounting classes,1,0
sw2822A-ms98-a,75,A,357.110625,369.54325,12.432625,yeah and uh but yeah it's that's something that's going to be uh a necessity for accountants because you you know it's you can do so much for more work with a computer then you can do you know doing it manually,1,0
sw2822A-ms98-a,79,A,387.004375,389.450125,2.44575,yeah you know it's just it would be,1,0
sw2822A-ms98-a,98,A,472.792875,479.73725,6.944375,yeah they uh they start are starting real early on the computers when he gets to school he will probably be using a computer,1,0
sw2822A-ms98-a,100,A,483.86275,489.189375,5.326625,he'll he'll know more about computer then you will and you'll be having to go back to school just too keep up with him,1,0
sw2822B-ms98-a,26,B,120.39625,126.836,6.43975,oh seems like it would be more fun any way my husband gets a kick out of building stuff for his self rather than buying it,1,0
sw2822B-ms98-a,61,B,254.955625,259.561125,4.6055,to a certain point i'd just get messed up and i would be totally lost,1,0
sw2822B-ms98-a,83,B,383.997625,389.934375,5.93675,i do our income taxes too and you're right it probably would be a lot easier if i use the computer ,1,0
sw2822B-ms98-a,98,B,457.58425,464.3495,6.76525,i know they've got toy computers more or less just for kids who just starting and he'll be four ,1,0
sw2823A-ms98-a,32,A,218.391,231.22075,12.82975,it's very difficult sometimes to to not think and say well God we have a little bit in savings let's   but you have to be quite um adamant and say you're not going to touch that so,1,0
sw2823A-ms98-a,51,A,303.149,309.04875,5.89975,you know and that's so important because today things can be so expensive they really can,1,0
sw2823A-ms98-a,66,A,360.439625,362.469875,2.03025,wouldn't that be great,1,0
sw2823A-ms98-a,106,A,528.153125,541.455,13.301875,i do we used to it got to be a great big hassle great big mess and i- i just don't do that so what i have is uh a paper and uh and i put two columns my husband on one side and me on the other side,1,0
sw2823B-ms98-a,46,B,308.3275,318.979625,10.652125,well if you if you really look at it the kids that are are born today by the time it's college time which will be it will be cost prohibitive if if parents don't do it,2,0
sw2823B-ms98-a,51,B,331.920625,340.294375,8.37375,and and there i don't think there's a lot of opportunity uh in the future for grants and loans and that kind of stuff because_1 i don't i just don't think it's going to be there,1,0
sw2823B-ms98-a,52,B,340.294375,345.066625,4.77225,so i think if parents don't provide it's it's not going to be there,1,0
sw2823B-ms98-a,54,B,346.7965,358.17275,11.37625,who knows how much that's going to take i mean what we're taking out now may be enough it may not be and uh just don't know or there may be far more there than is ever needed but if it's if it's extra,3,0
sw2824A-ms98-a,39,A,320.977625,326.914125,5.9365,uh you know you name anything that's ever happened to you is going to be tied into either your social security number or your driver's license,1,0
sw2824B-ms98-a,4,B,31.53275,43.691,12.15825,cards little little card i answered in the mail that had a bunch of topics would you be interested in this be interested in that an it was kind of a little survey type deal and i checked off a few things and,2,0
sw2824B-ms98-a,7,B,55.096125,69.34325,14.247125,and within about a month i would say i had ten fifteen calls from different brokers uh asking me questions all sorts of things about what i would be wi- interested in investing in and how much i had to invest and,1,0
sw2824B-ms98-a,8,B,69.34325,80.994,11.65075,and i was kind of curious and i guess i got my answer but it was uh a bit much and to this day it has continued considerably it's i guess it's going to be hard to get off of that little list now,1,0
sw2824B-ms98-a,10,B,84.347125,98.519125,14.172,not really an invasion it's public record it's it's not uh not even they never told you it would be considered private but whenever you buy a house uh the purchase price is there for everybody to see where it's located is there and,1,0
sw2824B-ms98-a,14,B,130.347375,138.8015,8.454125,and marketing is uh seems to be the driving factor for most of these invasions of privacy as people call them_1 so,1,0
sw2824B-ms98-a,33,B,254.989,269.59025,14.60125,uh you just happen to be within a couple of houses of that person and you have to listen at the exact right time and it's fairly {staticky} and on occasion you'll get two to three of them_1 at once because the radios usually don't have the control that's needed to ,1,0
sw2824B-ms98-a,34,B,269.59025,281.4675,11.87725,screen them_1 out and it's not the worlds most interesting thing to listen to but uh it it can be done relatively cheaply and i guess some people for lack of anything else to do do that kind of thing,1,0
sw2824B-ms98-a,48,B,348.985,363.10475,14.11975,but uh i guess the idea that if you ever let it become a an all right thing to do for the masses then you'll never be able to get that privilege back  once gone it's going to be gone forever,2,0
sw2825A-ms98-a,12,A,63.174375,65.838125,2.66375,would be our night that um,1,0
sw2825B-ms98-a,4,B,11.883125,22.657,10.773875,and i'm trying to figure out how how to feed him so he'll eat this stuff  and the kids will eat it too and it's not going to be fattening high in fat or high in cholesterol,1,0
sw2825B-ms98-a,5,B,22.657,28.31375,5.65675,get's to be a a real chore with little kids who basically want every thing covered in cheese,1,0
sw2825B-ms98-a,31,B,202.48675,205.89,3.40325,now in Texas it would have to be ten fifteen,1,0
sw2825B-ms98-a,74,B,417.8085,422.2775,4.469,it can still be pink in the middle and that makes all the world of difference,1,0
sw2825B-ms98-a,95,B,506.10325,509.5775,3.47425,and they've gotten to be kind of food snobs one of them went over to,1,0
sw2825B-ms98-a,102,B,536.215375,547.333,11.117625, you'll be surprised you'll be really surprised at just how simple it is and and it's not a a clear cut you know this this this and this it's kind of to taste,2,0
sw2826A-ms98-a,78,A,305.913125,313.904,7.990875,and there's so much so so many people on the lower end of those who who are going to be the the drop outs and the,1,0
sw2826A-ms98-a,85,A,333.017,336.196125,3.179125,of the jobs that is out there to be done,1,0
sw2826A-ms98-a,86,A,336.196125,340.787,4.590875,in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be,1,0
sw2826A-ms98-a,118,A,455.922875,463.104,7.181125,and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so they she would be able to interact with them and uh,1,0
sw2826B-ms98-a,57,B,278.85025,283.44775,4.5975,um the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained for now,1,0
sw2826B-ms98-a,91,B,419.7025,424.116,4.4135,it's very helpful because it let's me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do,1,0
sw2827A-ms98-a,28,A,85.840875,96.729875,10.889,but um yeah so that's what i'm going to be cooking you know i thought i would have like an {antipasta} um salad first and um then just something for desert you know bread and wine and cheese stuff like that,1,0

sw2827B-ms98-a,24,B,95.033625,97.665375,2.63175,that would be great have you made pasta before,1,0
sw2827B-ms98-a,28,B,107.896125,118.28325,10.387125,it actually is if if if you have a food processor i don't know if you have a food processor or not actually it it turns out that i- i- if if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply,1,0
sw2827B-ms98-a,68,B,300.67875,304.435125,3.756375,and that seems to so wok food seems to be our our thing,1,0
sw2828A-ms98-a,21,A,136.86725,146.186875,9.319625, i've done about all i can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people,1,0
sw2828A-ms98-a,36,A,225.71975,235.61625,9.8965,i think that's absolutely right they the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board you're going to be,1,0
sw2828A-ms98-a,48,A,316.816,330.78075,13.96475,some college kid who might not be all that bright to begin with was thrown into a classroom with a teacher who was harried and overworked and uh had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions,1,0
sw2828A-ms98-a,51,A,347.6275,355.6245,7.997,there are lots of things that could be done in that line including things like videotaping because it wouldn't be hard,2,0
sw2828A-ms98-a,61,A,408.42275,415.857375,7.434625,yeah well another thing i think would be helpful would be to have some sort of uh,2,0
sw2828B-ms98-a,38,B,199.6445,210.422,10.7775,and if there was a way to through the public mind set that image to be a little higher esteem a little uh uh a little more prestige to being a teacher,1,0
sw2828B-ms98-a,40,B,221.270625,226.69075,5.420125,and then if you paid them more you'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them,1,0
sw2829A-ms98-a,9,A,26.09575,36.71025,10.6145,well uh well Star Star Search who want-  really Star Trek well uh well this is this this cannot be compared to the old Star Trek,1,0

sw2831A-ms98-a,7,A,59.82,65.97425,6.15425,i think the le- that there ought to be legislation that make makes it more equitable for uh depending on how much you earn,1,0
sw2831A-ms98-a,8,A,65.97425,72.685,6.71075,yeah i sure do uh-huh i we think everybody ought to be paying their fair share there still too many loopholes available to to get by with,1,0
sw2831A-ms98-a,31,A,181.849875,191.615375,9.7655,i used to be able to do that but uh i can't now and so then there's also the problem now where i've got some contributions that were tax deductible and some that aren't and i have to keep those separate,1,0
sw2831B-ms98-a,4,B,13.99425,24.437625,10.443375,and i kept saying no i felt like what we ought to do is cut spending and keep taxes the way they were well granted maybe the only way they could keep the spending to be uh,1,0
sw2831B-ms98-a,5,B,24.437625,35.68,11.242375,that is curtail the spending and cut it was to cut taxes forcing spending to have to be cut but uh i always felt like the Congress uh just ought to shoulder responsibilities of biting the bullet,1,0
sw2831B-ms98-a,6,B,35.68,42.280375,6.600375,uh that they uh uh are are supposed to be able to uh you know handle shoulder,1,0
sw2831B-ms98-a,18,B,82.392375,90.399625,8.00725,primarily the only thing that was supposed to be any longer tax deductible was your your first and second home mortgages the interest that is,1,0
sw2831B-ms98-a,32,B,143.6925,148.358375,4.665875,and you ought to get your salary taxed once and if you're able to save some money to be able to invest in,1,0
sw2831B-ms98-a,84,B,379.016,382.92725,3.91125,and that's not enough you need a eight percent loan to be able to do that,1,0
sw2831B-ms98-a,97,B,436.50825,442.93675,6.4285,puts in at a what they expect it to be for the next three years you know based on what it is right now subject to change of course,1,0
sw2832A-ms98-a,65,A,239.65525,244.15675,4.5015,you put right that you put around a bathtub that would be prettier,1,0
sw2832B-ms98-a,74,B,288.495625,302.92125,14.425625,and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house so if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main in the street you know and oh it's it can be really bizarre  and we never know where it's going to flood ,1,0
sw2832B-ms98-a,109,B,471.45725,480.78825,9.331,and i would go in and i'd turn on a light in the room you know and the light would come on and the whole thing would be full of water and i mean the light would still come on  it didn't blow up or anything,1,0
sw2833A-ms98-a,5,A,30.993625,44.1965,13.202875,i guess my my initial reaction would be that that i would be for it mainly from the standpoint that that i find um my health insurance not very effective and very expensive,2,0
sw2833A-ms98-a,6,A,44.1965,55.94175,11.74525,and so i you know am  probably being very naive   that that by by centralizing it it might get better and be cheaper,1,0
sw2833A-ms98-a,58,A,354.13225,367.477,13.34475,well but that's interesting because you know it's it- i don't know that much about it but my initial response would be more favorable and and perhaps i need to to learn more about it so that i'm not so naive on it,1,0
sw2833B-ms98-a,15,B,103.678125,114.439,10.760875,yeah well i guess uh uh like i said i- i- i don't really know that much about it i i've uh uh mine may be more prejudice than opinion you know i- i guess i've got uh,1,0
sw2833B-ms98-a,30,B,199.618,212.493125,12.875125,but if you go there if you're you know if you've got an emergency you have to be almost dead before you can get in li- you know in a timely manner because there are so many people sitting there waiting all the time,1,0
sw2833B-ms98-a,31,B,212.493125,219.315125,6.822,for medical services that you know if you may be there five or six hours you know for just normal treatment,1,0
sw2833B-ms98-a,40,B,297.308375,301.82575,4.517375, if it's if it's going to be run you know and supervised ,1,0
sw2834A-ms98-a,8,A,19.663375,28.070125,8.40675, so i guess our topic's going to be changes in the women's roles so it should be real interesting,2,0
sw2834A-ms98-a,74,A,218.405125,222.379625,3.9745,yes it shouldn't be destroyed yeah yeah,1,0
sw2834A-ms98-a,139,A,477.507,479.19475,1.68775,well that could be,1,0
sw2834B-ms98-a,18,B,57.793,70.165125,12.372125,very much and i think you'll have to agree and since we were in uh sort of the ground level the bra burning of the sixties and and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be,1,0
sw2834B-ms98-a,25,B,102.177,111.678,9.501,um to human beings i mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions and it's okay and i think,1,0
sw2834B-ms98-a,30,B,141.93575,146.372,4.43625,team it has to be a team partnership now and they both have to work,1,0
sw2834B-ms98-a,33,B,160.157875,172.7365,12.578625,you know women didn't know how to go about doing the careers and they wanted to compete with men they wanted to be like men and that's wrong i think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men men ,2,0
sw2834B-ms98-a,72,B,342.02225,352.9115,10.88925,i couldn't ask for a better life i mean if this is the way it had to be this is the best way i could possibly do it and and that has a lot to do with his strength and his,1,0
sw2834B-ms98-a,82,B,410.001,416.040625,6.039625,the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation,1,0
sw2834B-ms98-a,84,B,421.934375,434.307125,12.37275,i think we're going to see a generation of kids that you know are just going to be a little bit um  oh not very nurturing i think,1,0
sw2834B-ms98-a,98,B,526.492875,531.6,5.107125,be appreciated i think sometimes but then i'm not there so i don't know that,1,0
sw2835A-ms98-a,4,A,14.98975,28.573125,13.583375,and and ex- trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful and we did end up with uh IBM PCs which i now would    but that was before the Macintosh,1,0
sw2835A-ms98-a,52,A,302.441,311.273,8.832,it was just beginning to be recognized and noticed ten years ago i i know that because i was writing a a paper about it,1,0
sw2835A-ms98-a,73,A,428.937,438.384125,9.447125,in my day we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be sleeping   ,1,0
sw2835A-ms98-a,79,A,480.743875,490.801,10.057125,i certainly wouldn't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what uh my kids were likely to be like course one of them_1 was just a a an,1,0
sw2835A-ms98-a,94,A,555.21225,567.29925,12.087,people do seem to travel more it's much more common for people even teenagers to be going to Europe and South America and Asia uh,1,0
sw2836A-ms98-a,26,A,211.441,224.48925,13.04825,probably the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles  Mercedes Volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for uh jewelry,1,0
sw2836A-ms98-a,35,A,288.85425,294.49475,5.6405,uh but for the that would be certainly be a deterrent,2,0
sw2836A-ms98-a,38,A,307.91925,318.37925,10.46,uh i think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty you know in a lot of cases course i i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof uh,1,0
sw2836A-ms98-a,70,A,542.067875,550.14375,8.075875,it's a problem and i i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in stiffer in their penalties would be a definite deterrent and,2,0
sw2836B-ms98-a,54,B,231.807625,235.877375,4.06975,well what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime,1,0
sw2836B-ms98-a,64,B,289.9745,292.559125,2.584625,so you think that would be a deterrent,1,0
sw2836B-ms98-a,125,B,493.21175,501.4085,8.19675,i mean that sounds that's a deterrent too if you think the home owner might be armed right and awake hear you break in and you're gonna get shot,1,0
sw2837A-ms98-a,10,A,74.587375,83.848875,9.2615,but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch style home uh after having a,1,0
sw2837A-ms98-a,27,A,209.094625,224.594125,15.4995,and so i think some of the things that i did paid off for instance one thing that i did that might even be a good suggestion for you uh was something i did on the outside i love old estate estate sales,1,0
sw2837A-ms98-a,41,A,304.257625,309.565375,5.30775,it just needed to be all tied together so we made brick patios,1,0
sw2837B-ms98-a,89,B,356.163375,362.82175,6.658375,and you know they have to be doing something constantly and the patio that came with that house um,1,0
sw2837B-ms98-a,133,B,547.067375,561.615,14.547625,but uh i don't know of everything that i did i guess i enjoyed probably wallpapering the most and i thought that would be the hardest thing to do but um gosh you know i ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house,1,0
sw2838A-ms98-a,41,A,340.7675,351.743375,10.975875,they you know they say there should be no ban that it's not but i can't see why any uh o- on the street citizen should be ab- allow- to be allowed to have a machine gun,3,0
sw2838A-ms98-a,42,A,351.743375,362.488,10.744625,uh you know when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns it would be hard to decide but there are a few guns that uh just are not uh sport or,1,0
sw2838A-ms98-a,44,A,376.87675,391.368,14.49125,you know on credit cards well i i understand about the privacy act and everything  but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not that to me would not be an unreasonable thing and if they do course,1,0
sw2838A-ms98-a,46,A,400.386,404.8585,4.4725,and so it's not gonna be that they're buying them_1 course some of them_1 do,1,0
sw2838B-ms98-a,1,B,0,7.666125,7.666125,gun control seems to be a rather um timely topic with all that's going on legislation wise,1,0
sw2838B-ms98-a,4,B,25.705375,34.024375,8.319,would certainly call for a ban on certain types now the the wisdom as to which types that's gonna be a debate forever i would assume ,1,0
sw2838B-ms98-a,31,B,258.953,265.45975,6.50675,yeah about the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the the,1,0
sw2838B-ms98-a,37,B,319.077125,329.0315,9.954375,the what the original intent was they didn't have this problem back then    we change our rights with our social status they're man given rights and they can be taken away by a man so ,1,0
sw2838B-ms98-a,53,B,418.745625,429.061875,10.31625,crooks or whatever you wanna however you wanna word it so it's well this may be a never ending topic i got a couple of calls  waiting on me so i better let you go,1,0
sw2839A-ms98-a,4,A,15.3925,25.4905,10.098,uh i guess what i feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it there's got to be something when when we pay so much for the for the debt,1,0
sw2839A-ms98-a,16,A,100.376375,106.7265,6.350125,so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything if it's a good idea it can be done again,1,0
sw2839A-ms98-a,27,A,172.394375,182.76875,10.374375,yeah that's right the other thing about is i think uh limiting their time in office would be good i- i just can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got,1,0
sw2839A-ms98-a,33,A,202.9715,204.509625,1.538125,yeah wouldn't that be too bad,1,0
sw2839A-ms98-a,49,A,275.614625,282.9445,7.329875,you know and get things on a on an even if it were if it were a family we'd be up before the,1,0
sw2839A-ms98-a,81,A,450.049875,459.384,9.334125,no we need to get try to get hold of it and and have it be things be honest and and i guess in the fact i don't really mind paying taxes,2,0
sw2839A-ms98-a,93,A,520.743625,529.410875,8.66725,yeah there are a lot of p- places where they're in real trouble and and i think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too if they don't take if they don't take that early stand,2,0
sw2839B-ms98-a,23,B,130.895875,136.346125,5.45025,a drug agency that would be located there and he was the only one that wanted it,1,0
sw2839B-ms98-a,71,B,356.55875,361.657625,5.098875,i have two daughters one's in college already and one's about uh to be in high school but uh,1,0
sw2839B-ms98-a,72,B,361.657625,370.598125,8.9405,i think that paying for school schools is the schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime and so i don't mind paying for school taxes even though my kids will be out of it you know,1,0
sw2839B-ms98-a,89,B,448.085875,453.431125,5.34525,no that's right you don't want to uh you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be,1,0
sw2840A-ms98-a,11,A,66.63925,75.828375,9.189125,some of the so many problems i  i work in a high school are that kids don't have a a degree uh a of self-discipline which may be reflected,1,0
sw2840A-ms98-a,34,A,236.2525,242.737,6.4845,and uh there really needs to be a bridge some sort of transition,1,0
sw2840A-ms98-a,54,A,346.684625,357.232625,10.548,yeah i guess kids do mature at different ages too that's and you know as a teacher you you try to make be understanding that you know there are different ages kids are is ,1,0
sw2840A-ms98-a,56,A,363.916375,370.845,6.928625,um there i mean i mean we're have to be we're alerted there's all sorts of systems where suicide,1,0
sw2840A-ms98-a,68,A,434.1575,440.077,5.9195,and parents frequently resent when you ask them is there a problem that we should be aware of,1,0
sw2840A-ms98-a,78,A,492.78925,505.36425,12.575,and where we've been very fortunate but you know they had to be held accountable too i mean you know at some point a parent does help their kid but in in some ways but but you have to say at what point isn't the help becoming negative,1,0
sw2840B-ms98-a,4,B,9.052375,23.15125,14.098875,i think that in in uh recently with the i'm not sure if it's more a problem with American families or a problem with the school system they seem to be burdening the school system more and more with,1,0
sw2840B-ms98-a,68,B,398.543875,403.391,4.847125,i mean what are what are the what could they possibly be thinking i mean how ,1,0
sw2841A-ms98-a,19,A,74.733,77.641125,2.908125,they used to be a dollar here but it finally went up,1,0
sw2841A-ms98-a,77,A,320.41175,331.46425,11.0525,um uh i can't really quite remember and then we saw one uh some time back it's a shame i can't remember the titles of these for the benefit of this conversation although it may not be that the uh necessarily the uh,1,0
sw2841B-ms98-a,55,B,201.09475,206.806625,5.711875,he she'd be like no he he couldn't do that you can't beat up ten guys at once with guns and,1,0
sw2841B-ms98-a,73,B,306.109625,309.981875,3.87225,oh okay this was a comedy so it probably wouldn't be the same one,1,0
sw2843A-ms98-a,22,A,211.274625,217.31425,6.039625,well i think may be you like doing it alone you like doing it on your own time too,1,0
sw2843B-ms98-a,61,B,324.7235,337.215625,12.492125, yeah i think that's true um you know i found that oh i used to be just a fanatic walker even when i was pregnant with with my first child i- i walked two three times a day for,1,0
sw2843B-ms98-a,72,B,423.017125,433.900625,10.8835,but right now i'm taking water aerobics also and that's a little bit different it's it's more strenuous then i figured it would be um,1,0
sw2844A-ms98-a,46,A,193.147375,201.961875,8.8145,uh i feel like that there's going to be uh less crime or your neighbors going to be watching out for you um because i- it's practically it's in their backyard too,2,0
sw2844B-ms98-a,41,B,160.72175,168.89875,8.177,i've got a f- a four year old he'll be four and a three month old and it's scary  sometime-,1,0
sw2844B-ms98-a,57,B,244.91725,251.0415,6.12425,it had to be somebody that you know could do it in the middle of the night and you know they'd seen it earlier,1,0
sw2844B-ms98-a,61,B,264.36475,275.900625,11.535875,well the only things that we can do as citizens is you know like those uh watch groups that they'll have wal- but they can be dangerous too and i've thought about it you know uh,1,0
sw2845A-ms98-a,42,A,188.0445,199.341125,11.296625,different point of view yeah i think you have to be very careful in i- with the media in tha- for that reason because they they are not because they are very biased,1,0
sw2845A-ms98-a,43,A,199.341125,212.249625,12.9085,most of them_1 have very biased feelings it's hard to hard to get one i'll tell you the the we take the Insight magazine and i find it to be as uh about as unbiased as any i've found,1,0
sw2845A-ms98-a,52,A,260.361875,262.555125,2.19325,to be biased,1,0
sw2845A-ms98-a,62,A,291.9825,299.969625,7.987125,right right and i- it's such a valuable tool and and their should be some moral,1,0
sw2845A-ms98-a,63,A,299.969625,306.371125,6.4015,uh you know there's so many people to be duped ,1,0
sw2845A-ms98-a,77,A,352.950375,365.46975,12.519375,well that's true be awful if you couldn't read isn't it i've i've learned to appreciate that i've had some eye problems in the last four or five years and there are times when i couldn't read for one reason or another and it's a re- it's a it's awful,1,0
sw2845A-ms98-a,78,A,365.46975,380.102625,14.632875,the so the printed the printed or whatever word is really a valuable thing to us even though sometimes it may be slanted i think you need to learn to think and understand that you have to interpret,1,0
sw2845B-ms98-a,30,B,234.828875,246.02075,11.191875,the history of newspapers were to be a hundred percent biased that's all they were were that guys opinion he owned the press and he could say what he wanted and he got politicians in office and he did everything he wanted to,1,0
sw2846A-ms98-a,29,A,166.204,173.553125,7.349125,and uh so i think my first advice would be to go to a community college,1,0
sw2846B-ms98-a,16,B,68.52175,81.87725,13.3555,right uh i i guess uh one thing  from from my own personal experience uh the drive is the important or is i i consider to be the important part of going to college ,1,0
sw2847A-ms98-a,26,A,114.0235,121.8545,7.831,it really is it it's a great place to be and the uh it's nice to work with people uh who,1,0
sw2847A-ms98-a,52,A,272.76,284.970125,12.210125,and then i've got a book called Fashions in Science which is a sociology that explains uh why certain theories get to be popular in uh sociology and,1,0
sw2847A-ms98-a,110,A,557.711875,569.778625,12.06675,there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful but i was tickled to see that some publisher is uh reprinting those the James Thurber books for children,1,0
sw2847B-ms98-a,39,B,212.075625,214.676125,2.6005,i thought that was going to be some,1,0
sw2847B-ms98-a,47,B,247.333875,253.804125,6.47025,yeah secretaries i bet that used to be mostly men who were secretaries of any type for business,1,0

sw2847B-ms98-a,83,B,430.77775,444.366375,13.588625,about how shame can just be so paralyzing and people isolate and withdraw and then the third one that he came out with is now called Homecoming uh and uh there's a subtitle to it i never can remember what it is it's something like um A Journey,1,0
sw2847B-ms98-a,93,B,485.13725,499.846375,14.709125,that's in uh Arizona who used to be in Dallas it seems like we have a lot of these that have been in Texas called PM Melody who does a lot of writing on codependency and she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and uh,1,0
sw2848A-ms98-a,36,A,85.032,86.668875,1.636875,i think that'll be fun,1,0
sw2848A-ms98-a,40,A,92.25675,95.11975,2.863,and uh i think that'd be great,1,0

sw2848A-ms98-a,96,A,349.76375,356.676625,6.912875,so you could go up that way but it would be ou- it would be out of your way better f- from to go to her house at like up through Redding and,2,0

sw2849A-ms98-a,103,A,399.915125,407.612625,7.6975,um and my background's European heritage and their background it would be you know the we- i guess i would say the La- Latin or Latino heritage,1,0
sw2849B-ms98-a,38,B,153.00925,161.701125,8.691875,but i would want a very very very clear majority because if the minority can be so vociferous whether you're talking,1,0
sw2849B-ms98-a,80,B,360.014125,364.425,4.410875,at least at the present time that's the way the way the pendulum seems to be swinging right now,1,0
sw2850A-ms98-a,2,A,0.32,3.566125,3.246125,do you consider your company's benefits to be reasonably good,1,0
sw2850A-ms98-a,6,A,14.77925,20.810875,6.031625, i've found that to be true they're getting better but uh there's room for improvement,1,0
sw2850A-ms98-a,8,A,35.7685,48.257,12.4885,yeah well i'll have to agree with that uh if if you uh if your benefits plan isn't as good you're going to drive people away but uh it seems they're making an effort to to uh be better uh each year,1,0
sw2850A-ms98-a,12,A,63.398625,68.928125,5.5295,yeah well it's necessary to be competitive when i started work the they didn't have uh a dental plan,1,0
sw2850A-ms98-a,13,A,68.928125,79.112375,10.18425,and so you're on our own but uh that's improved uh immensely it still may not be competitive with other companies of our size but uh it's better than nothing right now,1,0
sw2850A-ms98-a,18,A,120.89675,134.013625,13.116875,right well i think uh other improvements could be made say in the medical plan as well we really don't we really don't do a great deal for uh preventive care they don't offer uh say uh physicals every few years,1,0
sw2850A-ms98-a,19,A,134.013625,138.433625,4.42,something like that uh if they could cover that it would be uh most beneficial i think,1,0
sw2850A-ms98-a,41,A,262.16225,266.379625,4.217375,oh sure well it's meant to be a long term savings plan like an IRA,1,0

sw2850B-ms98-a,15,B,46.610625,56.51225,9.901625,yeah and there's no reason to i don't think they consider it to be any uh particular reason to go out and have the very best in the industry,1,0
sw2850B-ms98-a,43,B,191.2595,203.76175,12.50225,the cost are going up and the benefits are coming down you know they true they may be coming down at a slower rate because of the cost management things that they're doing but you know the benefits are coming down,1,0
sw2850B-ms98-a,64,B,299.266,310.088,10.822,well  yeah i guess i guess in a way they're they are they really are starting that now with the uh the smoker premiums that they're going to be starting,1,0
sw2850B-ms98-a,67,B,329.196125,338.305375,9.10925,but you know that's i guess that's i guess that's the way it should be i i'm i'm not sure i- it is it's different from the way it has been,1,0
sw2850B-ms98-a,85,B,426.5165,437.457,10.9405,i i wouldn't be surprised uh i never had heard a number of how many actually signed up but i i do know that they were trying to get people to do it uh you know which is good because it is uh,1,0

sw2853A-ms98-a,19,A,96.0435,99.121,3.0775,the- there could be some serious accidents,1,0

sw2854A-ms98-a,75,A,346.026,353.199375,7.173375,you know to be at home because actually i had my grandmother with me from the time she was from the time she was ninety two until she died at ninety seven,1,0
sw2854A-ms98-a,99,A,477.953,485.965125,8.012125,actually there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood is there seem there are several uh uh m- mothers who stay home,1,0
sw2854B-ms98-a,5,B,14.297875,18.764375,4.4665,uh the ones that can afford to have live in nannies they seem to be having an okay time,1,0
sw2854B-ms98-a,8,B,31.689375,37.28425,5.594875,uh but i there must be some good service out there if you really look and pay for it,1,0
sw2854B-ms98-a,16,B,59.333125,65.130375,5.79725,how strong the maternal instinct's going to be they tell me it's going to be  do you have children,2,0

sw2855A-ms98-a,68,A,374.279125,382.650625,8.3715,i guess i guess you know like i say if you know if you're going on a big hunting trip and you're going with two or three other guys that were good at it and that kind of stuff you know it might be okay for a few days,1,0
sw2855A-ms98-a,72,A,401.509,405.718875,4.209875,yeah some of those things are pretty good yeah yeah some of those things would be okay,1,0
sw2855A-ms98-a,73,A,405.718875,410.665,4.946125,that would be a little probably a little drastic with kids but for you know two adults it it's rough enough,1,0
sw2855A-ms98-a,94,A,496.412375,499.321875,2.9095,sounds like it sounds like it would be okay for a few days,1,0
sw2855A-ms98-a,103,A,521.61325,532.11025,10.497,sometimes you know i i think it would be kind of neat maybe if she just wanted to get a little tent or something and you know once we get a fence in the backyard and uh and just let her camp out maybe until till,1,0
sw2855A-ms98-a,108,A,540.79175,545.346125,4.554375,yeah she she looks like she might be an outdoors person eventually but,1,0

sw2855B-ms98-a,22,B,91.647,103.3095,11.6625,someplace like that where you like you say you can get way out in the middle of nowhere you know where you can really be away from civilization i- i would feel safer there than i would some of these little uh tent site areas you know,1,0
sw2855B-ms98-a,30,B,132.032875,144.951,12.918125,i found a problem here too since we moved to Texas three years ago i was feeling like there's places w- without fire ants or that aren't like all summer long it's so hot i you know i don't want to be out there when it's a hundred and ten degrees out trying to sleep,1,0

sw2856A-ms98-a,17,A,101.236125,107.115375,5.87925,that's i mean that's adequate or do you think both parents need to be there,1,0
sw2856A-ms98-a,52,A,307.07,314.30825,7.23825,had an emergency but you know if it's possible to be pretty much a a nine to five,1,0
sw2856A-ms98-a,73,A,415.585125,428.5005,12.915375,would be affected by the career that you have chosen would you have taken a more uh work for yourself job like maybe i don't know lawyer or whatever the s- the standard nine to five job,1,0
sw2856A-ms98-a,97,A,521.932,534.686125,12.754125,yeah it's a serious  right now it's a serious tired puppy but uh hopefully in the future it'll be a serious dog but there again we steered away from the topic a little bit but uh,1,0

sw2856B-ms98-a,12,B,106.708125,113.554,6.845875,i think it needs to be combination of those that there are some things that uh,1,0
sw2856B-ms98-a,42,B,372.617,387.243,14.626,well that tends to be true of of uh anyone who's in business pretty much for themselves uh you know a lawyer has that same type of of freedom uh i would think an accountant does,1,0
sw2856B-ms98-a,76,B,568.624625,582.14975,13.525125,well that'll be some of it but you know those my daughter is eleven and i look back on those times wh- when we first brought her home from the hospital and she was a night person from day one,1,0
sw2858A-ms98-a,20,A,105.9345,114.438875,8.504375,yeah i i think i think that would be the ideal situation i think that a lot of people like in my case i i do shift work,1,0
sw2858A-ms98-a,22,A,117.1595,126.650625,9.491125,um i have to be at work at at X hour you know at this at at a certain hour and i can't it's not flexible,1,0
sw2858A-ms98-a,23,A,126.650625,139.95,13.299375,um it it would be nice uh to be able to have flexible hours and and maybe after we decide to have kids i i might find a job that has flexible hours i woul- i hope so anyway um but i would i don't know ,2,0
sw2858A-ms98-a,33,A,175.79025,184.7525,8.96225,yeah i ideally it w- it would be nice to be able to just have like  back in the old days you know back like whe- when i grew up ,2,0
sw2858A-ms98-a,36,A,198.2395,202.57325,4.33375,and that was nice and i liked that and i would hope that i would be able to give that to my kids,1,0
sw2858A-ms98-a,37,A,202.57325,210.575,8.00175,but i think with the way the future is um economy wise i don't think it's going to be realistic,1,0
sw2858A-ms98-a,54,A,312.81675,323.247375,10.430625,of course be able to teach them right from wrong i hope i hope to be able to spend um their growing up years being in the home you know not having to work,2,0
sw2858A-ms98-a,58,A,345.85075,349.723375,3.872625,that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working,1,0
sw2858A-ms98-a,59,A,349.723375,355.140875,5.4175,and i'd i'd like to be able to do that i'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids,3,0
sw2858A-ms98-a,66,A,378.383125,387.386,9.002875,and i and i don't i don't really see that that trend changing much if anything i think there's going to be fewer and fewer uh single income families ,1,0
sw2858B-ms98-a,37,B,145.6135,154.633125,9.019625,they like when i worked on second shift um their paren- their kids go to school during the day and then they wouldn't see them at night because they would be in you know at work and the kids are going to be in bed,2,0
sw2858B-ms98-a,83,B,354.839125,364.799625,9.9605,do volunteer work and be in clubs and stuff yeah i agree i hope that happens in my case,1,0
sw2858B-ms98-a,94,B,393.592875,397.553125,3.96025,that may not necessarily be consistent with yours,1,0
sw2859A-ms98-a,9,A,43.864875,53.93425,10.069375,and that was not the thing to be in Dallas when they their preseason games at the stadium you know where the Cowboys versus what do you think they're going to do this year,1,0
sw2859A-ms98-a,50,A,248.754875,252.170125,3.41525,i can't remember his my mind went blank today it must be the heat um,1,0

sw2859A-ms98-a,81,A,429.808,434.143375,4.335375,i said uh you know wouldn't they be defeating their purpose to go away from the NFL,1,0
sw2859A-ms98-a,111,A,554.117,564.483125,10.366125, probably my husband should be too i just you know you just go through and you check those subjects and you go well  there's not too much well listen i won't keep you on a nice Sunday afternoon,1,0
sw2859B-ms98-a,17,B,53.572375,58.53,4.957625,oh they may be a little better but uh they got a long way to go,1,0
sw2859B-ms98-a,98,B,440.97625,446.501625,5.525375,yeah the Vikings to me will always be Fran Tarkenton though ,1,0
sw2859B-ms98-a,112,B,487.742125,496.5385,8.796375,well he's he's getting old enough to be uh his legs wearing out but the last time i saw him play when he was healthy he looked mighty good,1,0
sw2859B-ms98-a,114,B,499.045375,502.38975,3.344375,it'll be it'll be Aikman yeah,2,0
sw2859B-ms98-a,115,B,502.38975,510.841625,8.451875,oh Aikman himself if he had some talent around i think they'd be a super team but he can't do it by himself he's got to have a line in front of him that knows how to block,1,0
sw2859B-ms98-a,122,B,547.318375,558.8615,11.543125,they uh got i've forgotten my son keeps up with this more than i in fact he should be on this network he's the one that knows all about sports  yeah hm,1,0

sw2860A-ms98-a,30,A,145.855125,157.835375,11.98025,uh as as they've gotten older when they were younger we would go to the beach but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things and that there would be a a feature each day,1,0
sw2860A-ms98-a,31,A,157.835375,170.646375,12.811,whether it would be going to one summer we uh we went up to New England and we went to the marble quarries up there and uh uh to see that and another day we fish hatchery and so we did,1,0
sw2860A-ms98-a,55,A,275.303125,285.754125,10.451,and when they do there's a reason for it that they're sharing it and you want to be avail- at least i've wanted to be available when they for some reason they had they were bouncing something off of me,2,0
sw2860A-ms98-a,103,A,522.214125,528.8545,6.640375,but it was uh and it was and you know it was fun but that's a tradition and they will those will be passed on to them when they,1,0
sw2860B-ms98-a,48,B,205.104125,209.2205,4.116375,you want to be around for the crisis and things like that and,1,0
sw2860B-ms98-a,52,B,223.912875,238.231,14.318125,with so many more women choosing professional careers there are fewer of them home in the afternoons and i don't think it needs to be the mothers but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours,3,0
sw2860B-ms98-a,89,B,410.28,420.34175,10.06175,well everyone makes it's own model but uh it it seems that there should be some continuity and it's helpful to have uh things that,1,0
sw2860B-ms98-a,120,B,537.271,545.724375,8.453375,and that is the trend in a lot of uh lower class areas for the grandmothers to be raising the children,1,0
sw2861B-ms98-a,104,B,464.848875,471.244375,6.3955,but no i i really do like my neighborhood it's close enough to DFW i can be at the airport in ten minutes,1,0
sw2861B-ms98-a,106,B,479.087625,489.4835,10.395875,and uh uh i like living real close to an airport because when i get home from a trip i want to get home i don't want to drive forty five minutes you know after i get home i want to be home,1,0
sw2861B-ms98-a,109,B,502.923125,515.194625,12.2715,i guess if i lived right on the flight pattern it would be different but uh i don't i like i like to watch airplanes a fact i can lay in my bed at night and watch the planes coming in DFW and i'm,1,0
sw2861B-ms98-a,113,B,536.7625,542.0035,5.241,     must be  they i hadn't thought of that but    ,1,0
sw2861B-ms98-a,115,B,550.814375,555.97375,5.159375,there must be thirty airplanes circling above not over my house but over DFW,1,0
sw2862A-ms98-a,77,A,406.280125,409.052,2.771875,but uh he's got to be way up there,1,0
sw2862A-ms98-a,126,A,596.2435,599.13125,2.88775,basketball's gotten to be a lot of fun,1,0
sw2862B-ms98-a,43,B,181.806625,191.480875,9.67425,a lot of teams will will will win the play-offs and then the next year they'll be all they'll be too busy doing their endorsements and stuff to ,2,0
sw2862B-ms98-a,113,B,459.681,463.46075,3.77975,it must not be according to their how they did during the year,1,0
sw2863A-ms98-a,2,A,0.81975,6.31125,5.4915, okay obviously the team that i support would be the Cowboys um,1,0
sw2863A-ms98-a,8,A,34.114625,46.0025,11.887875,so uh ever you know since that i used to be such a an avid fan you know it was ridiculous but now quite honestly i i think that i support the Oilers as much as anybody,1,0
sw2863A-ms98-a,59,A,186.888375,199.287,12.398625,oh yeah you know it was just like you were so spoiled it was such a novelty if they lost a game you know and they could lose one game out of you know the whole season and people would just be completely up in arms,1,0
sw2863A-ms98-a,66,A,225.3695,237.43275,12.06325,but if uh Jerry Jones continues to pay these guys what you know they say they're paying them i don't know you know i think it depends on you end up you know the best players will come there if they're going to be paid the most so,1,0
sw2863A-ms98-a,71,A,275.092875,289.516875,14.424,you know it'd just be so aggravating when they did win and then uh Jerry Jones would come out of the uh you know the press box i mean i would just go uh you know wild it's like it ruined the whole game for me because i had to look at him you know,1,0
sw2863A-ms98-a,75,A,314.894125,317.721125,2.827,they'll eventually be a contender so,1,0
sw2863B-ms98-a,24,B,107.741625,117.66975,9.928125,uh kind of like the Oakland Raiders used to be the real bad team and they were they were mean and we had so many penalties and it gets really you just really get ticked off,1,0
sw2863B-ms98-a,50,B,316.603375,330.5345,13.931125,well this should be uh we did pretty well last year so i'm thinking this ought to this ought to be a good year for us so well h- have you been involved at all in this new World Football League i haven't watched the first thing,2,0
sw2863B-ms98-a,72,B,460.293875,468.182375,7.8885,you know if we don't do something with him at the helm you know then it may be downhill then for us for a while,1,0
sw2864A-ms98-a,37,A,195.6665,208.452625,12.786125,some work but most of them_1 don't i think they're trying too hard on the pushing but that seemed to that seemed to be pretty good i don't i don't i liked that um i haven't seen any of the real,1,0
sw2865A-ms98-a,5,A,15.760625,29.2125,13.451875,and uh the second one which i don't know if you'd go along with or not is that maybe a lot of women are not as uh likely to want to be dominated as past times,1,0
sw2865A-ms98-a,38,A,312.745875,326.612875,13.867,well i'll tell you what worries me a little bit about uh the role of women these days and i'm hoping that that's going to be a change and i don't know if you see it or not my husband doesn't always uh,1,0
sw2865A-ms98-a,39,A,326.612875,338.49925,11.886375,see it or understand it uh and that is the uh the trial of trying to be the superwoman the supermom the,1,0
sw2865A-ms98-a,40,A,338.49925,349.958,11.45875,yes and uh i have gone through that uh myself and it is hell it really is is tough and to be able to excuse myself,1,0
sw2865A-ms98-a,42,A,354.832,366.490375,11.658375,and i g- i ha- i think the woman pretty much has to do it themselves but i believe that in the future that they're going to stop trying to be all things,1,0
sw2865B-ms98-a,9,B,43.13325,52.714625,9.581375,and yes i am i i you know i i feel very confident that if you know something were to happen to me or to us either one that uh you know she would be,1,0
sw2865B-ms98-a,17,B,105.84,110.303125,4.463125,stepping out and saying what you want to say and what needs to be said ,1,0
sw2865B-ms98-a,19,B,119.07675,129.609,10.53225,yes i i i that's even even uh upper management is is uh i think is going to be a a coming thing for for women too uh,1,0
sw2865B-ms98-a,39,B,265.44125,272.99675,7.5555,there will be you know in the business world there will be more uh opportunities more expansion of the women's role in business,2,0
sw2865B-ms98-a,55,B,366.988625,374.36125,7.372625,right i i think they'll be uh  you know in in the political area i suppose uh,1,0
sw2865B-ms98-a,57,B,385.544875,399.235625,13.69075,and and i think that that if that's the the situation for women they will have had their family life and their business life you know may be earlier and then move into politics,1,0
sw2865B-ms98-a,62,B,426.136,440.40775,14.27175,well i i think that's uh that's the truth a- and i i think that there's i think and this is uh may be a bad thing for me to say but i think that women have a higher moral uh character for the most part,1,0
sw2866A-ms98-a,98,A,454.947625,460.575375,5.62775,yeah well they might be car pooling too do they car pool in are they driven by themselves,1,0
sw2866B-ms98-a,9,B,46.313375,52.34325,6.029875,so it's so much easier to sit there and besides i can be doing other things and still listening to the news,1,0
sw2867A-ms98-a,5,A,27.88225,34.99775,7.1155,i don't quite understand the NRA's uh CIA type stand it seems to me they'd be,1,0
sw2867A-ms98-a,7,A,49.10775,64.00975,14.902,and i don't quite understand the the Uzis and all that i think those should be banned i think that uh y- oh yeah hunters uh should get whatever they think they need but heck we've had hunting r- rifles for a hundred years and so uh,1,0
sw2867A-ms98-a,44,A,259.12775,272.65125,13.5235,to me gun control is not going to control it but the parents you know a teenager you know below eighteen or whatever the age should be right uh guns should be an adult should be responsible now i think that if you have a gun an adult,3,0
sw2867A-ms98-a,52,A,308.82825,319.8725,11.04425,i'm not sure it should be part of a crime bill i think i i i think guns need controls intelligent controls but i don't think it has maybe a one percent relationship directly to crime,1,0
sw2867A-ms98-a,53,A,319.8725,333.275375,13.402875,uh buying Uzis and all that may you know i think that the cops should have the  weapons and whatever they need but i don't think the average uh plinker or hunter needs to go out and buy be able to buy that i don't think he should uh,1,0
sw2867A-ms98-a,54,A,333.275375,336.195,2.919625,be allowed to buy an Uzi or something,1,0
sw2867A-ms98-a,58,A,356.006625,369.4545,13.447875,i know it's it's shooting against people you know they go out i i've seen them_1 on TV and they actually have these little clubs where they go out and practice shooting each other you know i mean uh yeah and i i think uh it should be in the hunting realm,1,0
sw2867A-ms98-a,60,A,381.573375,394.48825,12.914875,practice ranges and teach it you know and rather than just uh try to  lobby for it you know they they ought to be come out in the open uh and open up some maybe they do have a lot of good ranges but the ones i go to are just ranges you know i don't,1,0
sw2867A-ms98-a,78,A,518.657125,528.72725,10.070125,that's a good question yeah the i own i have girls so they haven't been in scou- doe- does scouting have a gun section where they they teach them_1 twenty twos and all that oh that's great that's great i think that's the way it should be,1,0
sw2867A-ms98-a,84,A,544.0575,549.31425,5.25675,yeah i again that's why i don't think it should be part of a criminal or a crime bill because they,1,0
sw2867A-ms98-a,88,A,587.531125,599.8495,12.318375,maybe to get the the the the guns into a controlled atmosphere where the true hunter you know it has a registered gun and people that allow other children to to get access to a gun should be fined you kn-,1,0
sw2867B-ms98-a,16,B,113.26625,125.967625,12.701375, this isn't just really great hunting country   you know there's not a lot of access you almost have to go like to an indoor range or something to to be able for your children to learn gun safety,1,0
sw2867B-ms98-a,49,B,393.849125,404.622,10.772875,well there used to be uh i grew up in Irving we live in Plano now there used to quite a few along the Trinity River Bottom and whatnot that you could go to and out in Euless and uh,1,0
sw2868A-ms98-a,50,A,138.02275,140.021375,1.998625,it's got to be the water,1,0
sw2868A-ms98-a,65,A,176.1715,187.84975,11.67825,you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and and just really and then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail we did quite a bit of hiking,1,0
sw2868A-ms98-a,98,A,310.060625,322.732125,12.6715,we we've tra- we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could,1,0
sw2868B-ms98-a,16,B,44.8325,52.55625,7.72375,that would be a to me a really nice vacation because i'm i'm not in physical shape for something like that but uh,1,0
sw2868B-ms98-a,51,B,193.80525,200.9165,7.11125,not not really so much if if if there was some place that that we went to where there was hiking involved i i would be,1,0
sw2868B-ms98-a,54,B,212.3665,216.247875,3.881375,yeah our next vacation will will be scuba diving i'm sure,1,0
sw2868B-ms98-a,64,B,242.730375,248.007125,5.27675,is probably it legal anyway would be probably about sixteen ,1,0
sw2868B-ms98-a,89,B,376.692375,380.948625,4.25625,you know not be settled anywhere just see see the rest of the country,1,0
sw2868B-ms98-a,94,B,397.789375,412.3775,14.588125,uh but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time and you know he'll say this is my itinerary i'm going here here and here and i'll be back in about two months ,2,0
sw2869A-ms98-a,32,A,150.451375,154.812875,4.3615,well it could very well be uh there is a definite racial split here,1,0

sw2885A-ms98-a,63,A,274.14125,286.529,12.38775,um that really stand out are the people that that end up being the supervisors of the departments or the managers or whatever and so even though it might be belittled when they first go for the job,1,0
sw2885B-ms98-a,4,B,8.954,23.54,14.586,um and the while their p- salaries still aren't there yet the opportunities for women who are at least driven uh do do tend to be a little bit more compatible with uh changes in life style,1,0
sw2885B-ms98-a,11,B,60.263,74.1265,13.8635,uh go- gotten there by uh rather um unsavory means uh you know  trapping everybody up along the way um when uh uh they may not be necessarily liked but if when a woman does that she is ridiculed,1,0
sw2885B-ms98-a,36,B,230.835625,238.87425,8.038625,tend to find themselves in that position of of having to be uh sort of part of the secretarial pool it might not be called that but that boils down to what it is,2,0
sw2885B-ms98-a,75,B,494.753875,509.115125,14.36125,oh yeah it it's very difficult so that needs to be done and ed- perhaps education will eventually do it but uh the idea that that all those uh things that were traditionally thought to be the housewife when she was home as a housewife are still hers even if she's out working,2,0
sw2886B-ms98-a,42,B,125.784875,130.88975,5.104875,well the last good book i read would be uh let me think ,1,0
sw2887A-ms98-a,37,A,222.251625,231.6665,9.414875,i mean i don't know um what other what other type of benefits do they have that i mean Canadian based companies  com- they have to be a little bit different than the American then,1,0
sw2887A-ms98-a,55,A,295.760375,306.065375,10.305,i don't know but if i were to rank them_1 i guess i would say next to income it's really just health benefits and then um for most people i know it would be day care like TI has no day care,1,0
sw2887A-ms98-a,63,A,344.753625,348.265,3.511375,developed as much as it could be for the size company as TI,1,0
sw2887A-ms98-a,85,A,441.048375,455.678875,14.6305,um-hum and i mean i mean i don't know how you and your husband are too but i mean we have friends that laugh at us and we i clip coupons and i said hey i'll probably do this even if i'm a millionaire which i won't ever be but i mean it's like because you just can't i mean it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something,1,0
sw2887A-ms98-a,93,A,515.197375,520.985375,5.788,he didn't even make ten dollars an hour and he has three kids and i went oh you know that has to be rough,1,0
sw2887A-ms98-a,95,A,522.59,537.17175,14.58175,but benefits i don't know i guess i guess one thing i'd like to see too and i i don't know how TI is about this but i'd like to see um employees rank and file be able to contribute more to their um the execution of their job,1,0
sw2887B-ms98-a,89,B,326.14875,328.115375,1.966625,they should be though,1,0
sw2888A-ms98-a,44,A,145.544875,147.86625,2.321375,yeah that'd probably be better,1,0
sw2888A-ms98-a,60,A,197.271375,202.184,4.912625,i think it would be nonex- pretty  nonexistent except maybe through the paper,1,0
sw2888A-ms98-a,61,A,202.184,206.147625,3.963625,uh i know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news,1,0
sw2888A-ms98-a,66,A,221.261875,226.3365,5.074625,but i think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again,1,0
sw2889B-ms98-a,8,B,26.980375,38.98,11.999625,um well i used to be more into crafts when i was younger like high school stuff i was in 4H and i did a lot of latch hook made rugs and stuff um,1,0
sw2889B-ms98-a,9,B,38.98,53.3,14.32,and uh i've learned how to crochet but i don't really know i mean i don't do it that much not really an indoor hobby type person unless the weather's really bad i'd rather be outside,1,0
sw2890B-ms98-a,6,B,27.388875,40.154875,12.766,uh my little girl she's seven and and just got through with soccer and so we would we'd have to split time and my husband would go one place and i'd go the other place but we one or the other would be at the games,1,0
sw2890B-ms98-a,37,B,177.7145,180.562125,2.847625,yeah yeah it can be that way,1,0
sw2891A-ms98-a,19,A,76.286875,86.525625,10.23875,so there's are there are an awful lot of movies that i just think are uh unconscionable to be shown on,1,0
sw2891A-ms98-a,30,A,116.2675,122.7215,6.454,but once in a while what i try to do is try to entice them into something that i think is going to be,1,0
sw2891A-ms98-a,49,A,201.342375,213.394125,12.05175,but they thought it was a good movie and uh i like Sean Connery so i said if it comes out on video i'll be willing to pay the two dollars to rent it and then if i'm bored i don't feel like i've lost   and i can turn it off,1,0
sw2891A-ms98-a,85,A,391.61175,402.968875,11.357125,how disgusting this was going to be and in the five minutes i watched there was no let up it was it was just filthy,1,0
sw2891A-ms98-a,92,A,452.650875,459.42175,6.770875,and i think that's got to be true if you look at what they    they think is the ideal  normal person ,1,0
sw2891A-ms98-a,119,A,589.873625,598.4285,8.554875,and you can go to a movie like that and you know that it's going to be entertaining and it's going to have some wit in the dialogue ,1,0
sw2891B-ms98-a,119,B,579.235375,588.748625,9.51325,oh that's neat though that's you know that's good i wish more teenagers would take up some of those that they realize that they can be entertained and,1,0
sw2892A-ms98-a,26,A,158.474375,161.812,3.337625,um-hum yeah he's getting to be a big boy really,1,0
sw2892A-ms98-a,41,A,206.499125,218.429375,11.93025,yeah i think that's probably the that that seems to be the guiding factor with the judges they say hey we'd like to convict more of them_1 but you know we don't have a place to put them_1 so what are we supposed to do ,1,0
sw2892B-ms98-a,81,B,288.4275,300.844375,12.416875,one guy said you know if they want to give out a free education there is a lot of poor people that'll like to have a uh degree from B U you know why give it to these criminals who aren't going to be able to use it anyway you know and i just,1,0
sw2893A-ms98-a,63,A,245.288625,251.23325,5.944625,there used to be one that was a twenty four hour that i used to go to but uh i actually prefer to work out alone,1,0
sw2893A-ms98-a,118,A,444.134125,448.84275,4.708625,it's probably i would think it would be hard on your your legs and your joints and stuff,1,0
sw2893B-ms98-a,39,B,168.000125,170.678875,2.67875,so she may be keeping that on purpose so ,1,0
sw2893B-ms98-a,48,B,204.174625,208.409,4.234375,and i can't quit smoking i've tried i was telling a friend of mine that be,1,0

sw2894A-ms98-a,5,A,14.438875,21.5105,7.071625,well i u- i used to be i- i was in the scouts for probably close to twenty years and i- i got my fill of it,1,0
sw2894A-ms98-a,25,A,122.24075,125.826125,3.585375,probably the other place would be somewhere like uh Puerto Vallerta,1,0
sw2894A-ms98-a,71,A,383.244125,393.290375,10.04625,well they've got plenty of that stuff there in fact i- i in fact you know through business you know i mean i've met a lot of nice people at companies that where i go and and we've gotten to be friends over the years and uh ,1,0
sw2894A-ms98-a,107,A,527.8005,540.95375,13.15325,yeah pretty much you you the only thing you have to be really you have to just be very cautious of just you know what you say to people you don't wanna tell them_1 anything that you know that that could possibly give them_1 the wrong idea,2,0
sw2894A-ms98-a,108,A,540.95375,553.23975,12.286,yeah that plus uh you know if you work for a government contractor you don't wanna tell them_1 things like that or you know whatever you just wanna be pretty low key just the just you know just participate as a tourist and try to stay out of,1,0
sw2894A-ms98-a,110,A,555.497625,564.938,9.440375,no you'd probably you know be better if you just you know say hey i'm you know i'm an artist or  or you know something other than what you are or you know,1,0
sw2894A-ms98-a,112,A,574.549,579.060125,4.511125,you just have to be very very cautious uh you don't wanna dress ,1,0
sw2894B-ms98-a,32,B,137.547375,148.99025,11.442875,and when we lived in the upper Midwest um we were talking about wouldn't it be nice in the winter to be able to just fly to Mexico um but one thing we never did was do that or go to places like Puerto Vallerta,2,0
sw2894B-ms98-a,75,B,288.77225,294.595,5.82275,that's yeah a place i mean that's i mean i see pictures i mean that's to us would be God's country,1,0
sw2894B-ms98-a,134,B,485.656,494.689125,9.033125,i'm kind of envious of somebody that gets to travel that much  but it it's like anything else it's not all it's cracked up to be when you're in a suitcase that often,1,0
sw2895A-ms98-a,55,A,287.432625,289.718375,2.28575,well i'll be da- and you've eaten them_1,1,0
sw2895B-ms98-a,32,B,219.262625,231.08775,11.825125,yeah i could see that would be then it wouldn't be such a an overpowering flavor you know it would be uh just just a flavor but not you know the real strong that's the only thing turnips have such a strong,3,0
sw2896A-ms98-a,8,A,25.16625,27.292375,2.126125,oh that would be interesting ,1,0
sw2896A-ms98-a,18,A,82.712375,85.24475,2.532375,oh yeah that should be nice,1,0
sw2896A-ms98-a,45,A,227.609375,235.10225,7.492875,could be yeah um if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too if it's paper it will probably shred,2,0
sw2896A-ms98-a,66,A,372.671375,383.333625,10.66225,trim out uh all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it and it can be done a whole lot faster,2,0
sw2896A-ms98-a,68,A,391.3365,398.84875,7.51225,and they dry fast so you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend if you have some help,1,0
sw2896A-ms98-a,72,A,418.055625,426.795125,8.7395,when pull it up um-hum well not i- if you leave it on for weeks it'll do that if you take it up the next day it should be fine ,1,0
sw2896B-ms98-a,19,B,97.872,101.904625,4.032625,um it's going to be a big experiment ,1,0
sw2896B-ms98-a,35,B,156.40575,167.986,11.58025,um-hum well we only have o- one only one of our bathroom has a window in it so i'm hoping that um it won't be too much of a a problem ,1,0
sw2896B-ms98-a,47,B,225.538625,229.38675,3.848125,so it may be the original wallpaper ,1,0
sw2896B-ms98-a,61,B,348.356,361.144875,12.788875,yeah well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because_1 it would be just plain painting it wouldn't be any kind of special um special effects type thing,3,0
sw2896B-ms98-a,62,B,361.144875,362.871125,1.72625,it would be just plain paint,1,0
sw2896B-ms98-a,88,B,520.093375,525.02675,4.933375,well we'll see how it goes  i may be just be flat painting over it ,2,0
sw2897A-ms98-a,55,A,332.70725,340.44575,7.7385,yeah that's what i what i think the- they should be able they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are,2,0
sw2897A-ms98-a,56,A,340.44575,349.356125,8.910375,and how much profit they're making instead of trying to cut everything down and then have everybody be unhappy and and have a constant turnover of people,1,0
sw2897B-ms98-a,9,B,35.180625,40.95575,5.775125,or or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't,1,0
sw2897B-ms98-a,43,B,233.0635,243.493,10.4295,uh-huh or maybe a ben- uh not really a benefit either but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls,1,0
sw2897B-ms98-a,59,B,324.596875,333.627375,9.0305,and at least you know financially in the short run but i would think that they would get a much greater turnover and that people would be dissatisfied working for them ,1,0
sw2898A-ms98-a,7,A,18.539125,25.99975,7.460625,uh be more of an amateur sport i'd like to see it turn back to like the Southwest Conference down here i would like to see Texas,1,0

sw2898B-ms98-a,110,B,488.03775,500.402,12.36425,Indiana State finals seems to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there the Pacers don't really draw that  of a crowd but you know the c- the high school games i mean that s- seems to be the big attraction and college ,2,0
sw2898B-ms98-a,116,B,529.443125,541.9915,12.548375,yeah seems like you could set the  the score at a hundred and then give them_1 five minutes to play and then it'd be the same result you know because_1 they they start they shoot so much and then the last,1,0
sw2898B-ms98-a,117,B,541.9915,546.102,4.1105,what five minutes they decide who's going to be the winner i guess ,1,0
sw2899A-ms98-a,42,A,207.40525,219.4245,12.01925,and i remember one professor wanted to have people over but people were you know just kind of scared to go over and are they going to be called brownnoser when uh so it's just sort of unaccepted you just kind of,1,0

sw2899B-ms98-a,50,B,291.704875,296.591875,4.887,i could be wrong about that but my experience with Texas schools has not been all that great,1,0
sw2900A-ms98-a,16,A,104.94225,113.280875,8.338625,with uh a great deal of integrity and uh people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree as a matter of fact if i'm injured or,1,0

sw2909B-ms98-a,11,B,34.74,45.3525,10.6125,my wife when she talked about the Middle East and everyone's afraid you know of how the war was going to go and everything i sai- i said i told her no it's just not going to happen there's not going to be any terrorism over here and there wasn't you know ,1,0
sw2909B-ms98-a,15,B,67.8625,80.320375,12.457875,a- and the last you know out of all the Asians we brought in there there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from from Asia and i think that there's got to be some sort of controls over that i mean this Asia mafia thing is getting out of hand,1,0
sw2909B-ms98-a,126,B,508.149625,513.193125,5.0435,uh although i guess Europe now that the Communism is falling apart that maybe there'll be,1,0
sw2909B-ms98-a,127,B,513.193125,517.046,3.852875,won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the Communist Comm- countries uh,1,0
sw2909B-ms98-a,131,B,526.028625,532.427875,6.39925,uh change maybe it'll be even out like trade you know so many people will,1,0
sw2910A-ms98-a,42,A,201.391875,210.964,9.572125,yeah well that's another one i read i forgot that i read the Wall Street Journal not as in depth as i used to because they their articles seem to be getting even longer and  ,1,0
sw2910A-ms98-a,44,A,212.04375,225.5195,13.47575,yeah uh i think i- i agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff uh i feel pretty well versed in in what i'm doing because i- i do spend more time on that than i do say on sports or ,1,0
sw2911A-ms98-a,93,A,491.0225,495.59575,4.57325,i still don't know what i want to be when i grow up and i'm twenty seven years old ,1,0
sw2911A-ms98-a,102,A,523.586875,529.71125,6.124375,i'm going to be there for them at least until they're in the second well until the baby starts,1,0
sw2911A-ms98-a,110,A,559.3115,568.9025,9.591,and we'll need it and like i said that's six dollars a day and oh i haven't really sat down and figured it out but i guess it'd be pretty easy three times six is what eighteen,1,0
sw2911B-ms98-a,48,B,196.62,207.136375,10.516375,my license tags everything i just you know and plus a huge salary increase and i thought God i'd be stupid if i don't take this and i wanted to come back to Texas anyway so,1,0
sw2912A-ms98-a,9,A,48.958125,61.96675,13.008625,and i needed something that would be able to haul a small boat but then i i um i because_1 i wanted to try water skiing and enjoying some water sports and things and that's one reason why i bought it but then right after i bought the truck i broke my foot,1,0
sw2912A-ms98-a,24,A,164.56,173.43225,8.87225,which actually you know can open the back and just take out your backseat and you can haul washers and dryers and almost anything in them so i think um i used to be,1,0
sw2912A-ms98-a,84,A,364.478,370.7015,6.2235,because if you had if you had kids you wouldn't say anything about sportier looking you'd be saying things like it has a good backseat,1,0
sw2912A-ms98-a,89,A,399.004,410.171875,11.167875,so we should get rid of yours because the three of us won't be able to go on trips i said but we can go on trips in mine you know we can travel anywhere with my truck so that's uh you know we l- i laugh about that um-hum,1,0
sw2913A-ms98-a,135,A,421.559125,426.3405,4.781375,yeah that'd be kind of hard for us we've only got one bathroom i don't ,1,0
sw2913A-ms98-a,140,A,436.349125,438.38275,2.033625,well that wouldn't be too bad,1,0
sw2913A-ms98-a,149,A,456.5245,468.5415,12.017,i know it's going to be on on the on CBS Tuesday night and and that's kind of what in a way you know how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff that's kind of how War of the Roses was,1,0
sw2913A-ms98-a,169,A,558.40025,564.46875,6.0685,whether it'll be any good or not so sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than,1,0
sw2913B-ms98-a,47,B,201.876,209.733125,7.857125, Kyle i'm on the telephone i'll be right i'll be right there  sorry  now you're glad you ain't got a four year old ,2,0
sw2913B-ms98-a,133,B,584.161125,594.789375,10.62825,was that with that blonde she pretended to be the boss or something yeah i rented that one night by myself i was home alone did you see Home Alone ,1,0
sw2914A-ms98-a,8,A,60.223375,68.816125,8.59275,so but uh probably if i had to say my most favorite one was probably be uh flying,1,0
sw2914B-ms98-a,55,B,261.050875,266.450375,5.3995,but uh again you know i'd like to be able to go ahead and take that someday and actually make a house of my own,1,0
sw2916A-ms98-a,40,A,238.5235,250.177625,11.654125,that are totally irrational they buy more than they need or less than they need or many times as much as they need in little quantities when they ought to be able to um,1,0
sw2916A-ms98-a,91,A,530.08975,540.26725,10.1775,surrounding land is all uh in preserves of one sort or other and it can't be developed so there's very little property that hasn't already been built on,1,0
sw2916B-ms98-a,102,B,375.817,383.403375,7.586375,um-hum something be done maybe  yeah that's a key is maybe i know i uh i,1,0
sw2916B-ms98-a,117,B,441.2,449.7535,8.5535,we should be getting a tax break because we get all  the town i live in gets all of the uh revenue from DFW because_1 it's in our city limits but,1,0
sw2917A-ms98-a,65,A,259.487625,268.080125,8.5925,yeah yeah that i would that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that i was you know juggling payments to different people,1,0
sw2917A-ms98-a,134,A,529.620125,537.483625,7.8635,yeah and especially if you if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be,1,0
sw2917A-ms98-a,147,A,578.239125,585.02275,6.783625,but but once i suppose you you prove yourself by paying this off next year you'll be in very good shape,1,0
sw2917B-ms98-a,54,B,251.184625,256.957,5.772375,but i think this they way the whole economy's is going right now it's just not good to be in debt,1,0
sw2917B-ms98-a,86,B,392.57025,401.6885,9.11825,uh mind set for not not even getting you know past that thirty days i- i would that's ideally the where where i would like to be,1,0
sw2917B-ms98-a,126,B,557.956875,564.328375,6.3715,be renting it like we're doing i mean we're basically you know kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away,1,0
sw2917B-ms98-a,135,B,583.79825,591.64225,7.844,yeah it's it's going to it's going to take quite a while um hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home,1,0
sw2918A-ms98-a,11,A,48.5785,54.71525,6.13675,and it included some seafood so that would probably be uh appropriate for you,1,0
sw2918B-ms98-a,5,B,22.301625,35.284,12.982375,so i would say most likely a dinner party would be you know would include some kind of fish seafood or you know or poultry type dish as the main course,1,0
sw2919A-ms98-a,18,A,78.368,83.868625,5.500625,so i guess on the other hand as a- as as good as this idea is it's got to be paid for,1,0
sw2919A-ms98-a,19,A,83.868625,94.048625,10.18,uh even though it's uh you know it it's it's never quite voluntary people have to be paid if they're asked to serve for a year in any capacity,1,0
sw2919A-ms98-a,58,A,248.676875,260.3685,11.691625,which uh could probably be one of those areas that uh could be uh privatized or civilianized or whatever some of the areas there you know for domestic use,2,0
sw2919A-ms98-a,71,A,300.502,312.067,11.565,so i uh you know there's a bit of a history of people serving the government and it doesn't have to be as the military you know if you go in just as a as an enlistee uh the wage isn't anything great,1,0
sw2919A-ms98-a,72,A,312.067,318.376,6.309,so if if you're asking for a year of service it doesn't have to be a wage comparable to the uh,1,0
sw2919A-ms98-a,73,A,318.376,328.88975,10.51375,if it's a required year it doesn't have to be a wage comparable to the private sector so it could be you know a wage enough to for have someone to live on to eat and if uh if in fact,2,0
sw2919A-ms98-a,74,A,328.88975,333.287625,4.397875,so i guess that it a lot of thinking would have to be done if it were implemented ,1,0
sw2919A-ms98-a,78,A,345.552875,354.115125,8.56225,how it's administered and how you know uh just the who uh who who would be exempted because i'm sure there would be exemptions to it,2,0
sw2919A-ms98-a,91,A,398.74675,408.292875,9.546125,um there're there're probably a lot of things that could be done uh on a volunteer basis so maybe they should do pilot projects to try it out to see how it works,1,0
sw2919B-ms98-a,6,B,17.129625,19.839125,2.7095,i'm will be forty nine in August,1,0
sw2919B-ms98-a,19,B,98.191,112.05525,13.86425,right i guess uh uh i've ha- i have had some thoughts in the past that uh this this service should not be uh performed for for areas that we don't need the service you know uh it's if it's uh,1,0
sw2919B-ms98-a,20,B,112.05525,119.978,7.92275,if it's voluntary service but it's being furnished by the government it should be to take the place of things that the government's doing already,1,0
sw2919B-ms98-a,45,B,201.11875,209.87425,8.7555,yeah i agree uh i- and and it would uh would be nice if we could get some uh some multiple use out of this you know maybe uh,1,0
sw2919B-ms98-a,77,B,363.307375,369.677375,6.37,oh even uh even uh running the uh the prison system might be a you know,1,0
sw2919B-ms98-a,78,B,369.677375,374.065,4.387625,a a an area  that could run could t- be taken care of,1,0
sw2919B-ms98-a,92,B,405.15175,412.837,7.68525,right and uh just to see what uh what all could be done yeah it's uh nice talking to you too okay bye-bye,1,0
sw2920A-ms98-a,101,A,358.596125,367.89075,9.294625,you know after Desert Storm or whatever we have a plant here that feeds one of the military contracts that should be cut you know that they advised on cutting,1,0
sw2920A-ms98-a,103,A,377.36225,390.16125,12.799,but you know if we don't cut some of these nationwide you know some of these expenses just have to be cut if we don't need such a large army and we don't need if the military comes out and says we don't need all these planes,1,0
sw2920A-ms98-a,130,A,494.922,504.653875,9.731875,a flexible solar material that it can be woven over top of something it could be it could be put on the top of airplanes to help power the plane,3,0
sw2920A-ms98-a,131,A,504.653875,508.966,4.312125,you know it uh it just it could be put on the top of automobiles to,1,0
sw2920A-ms98-a,154,A,594.334375,599.984,5.649625,i'm not sure what it was but it was uh Eisenhower i guess thought that you should be able to move tanks across the country,1,0
sw2920B-ms98-a,10,B,17.49825,20.961125,3.462875,well this is going to be the seventh year in a row that they've increased,1,0
sw2920B-ms98-a,84,B,331.05725,336.31775,5.2605,there's a lot of things that can be done uh the federal taxes are out of sight because of ,1,0
sw2921A-ms98-a,113,A,484.764625,499.688125,14.9235, that's what it is here yeah that's why we're at a point now we've uh we're adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what happens is uh you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get  we'll be staying in  so,1,0
sw2921A-ms98-a,114,A,499.688125,513.67275,13.984625,yeah that's kind of like where we're so we're considering Pennsylvania and we're just kind of you know toying with what exactly where we want to be you know a lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house and but i disagree with that i,1,0
sw2921A-ms98-a,118,A,519.661875,529.368375,9.7065,i know and it and the economy here in Dallas i mean it it's steady but it's still not going up and i um i just refuse to buy it um if i know i'm not going to be there for at least,1,0
sw2921A-ms98-a,125,A,562.29225,568.88675,6.5945,i mean it would probably be like your house on uh you know a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something,1,0
sw2922A-ms98-a,17,A,52.96975,54.724,1.75425,that won't be much longer,1,0
sw2922A-ms98-a,24,A,79.235875,91.363625,12.12775,we prob- i'm i'm sort of stuck i want half of me wants some sort of little sporty thing just for the hell of it because it may be the last time i can drive one for a long time and the other half of me says be pragmatic and get some sort of ,2,0
sw2922A-ms98-a,34,A,136.200375,142.39775,6.197375,right well it's a it's a it's note like the i've seen that Mazda van and and it seems like it would be the right thing then,1,0
sw2922A-ms98-a,38,A,158.787625,161.13475,2.347125,oh okay that'll be nice,1,0
sw2922A-ms98-a,82,A,335.22725,338.641,3.41375,it'd be nice to think that i could afford it mind you but,1,0
sw2922A-ms98-a,109,A,451.825,453.6845,1.8595,to be paying for a car,1,0
sw2922A-ms98-a,117,A,484.012,498.305125,14.293125,and she's up for the weekend   she's out babysitting in the next room  sort of perfect coincidence it's a perfect time to be talking about that car um but yeah it's just it's just you know i have little problems here and there you know um stupid things start to go like the uh ,1,0
sw2922B-ms98-a,30,B,160.193625,169.46275,9.269125,and that'll that'll help some and uh they're going to change the interior to where the backseat itself can either be removed or laid laying down into a bed,1,0
sw2922B-ms98-a,66,B,337.537,347.1235,9.5865,yeah i mean it'd be nice to be able to afford it but i i'm just not i even if i had the money i i'm i know for a fact i just wouldn't i wouldn't buy one i just can't bring myself to do that kind of stuff,2,0
sw2922B-ms98-a,86,B,448.830125,460.440375,11.61025,uh that's a long time right there in itself and then you don't want to turn around and and you know the next time you buy a car it's going to be more expensive and uh you don't want to start another payment that's going to be up around four or five hundred dollars a month,2,0
sw2923A-ms98-a,5,A,6.390125,10.21725,3.827125,probably  cutting edge rock would be the best way to describe it,1,0
sw2923A-ms98-a,13,A,49.45625,51.940375,2.484125,you wouldn't would never be exposed to,1,0
sw2923A-ms98-a,34,A,169.84575,179.013625,9.167875,it just gets to be more of a hassle than it's worth yeah you get a lot of thirteen and fourteen year olds and it's just a crowd of little kids,1,0
sw2923A-ms98-a,45,A,213.551,220.349375,6.798375,and it's it's okay the the acoustics could be better but like i say i haven't been down there to a concert since,1,0
sw2923A-ms98-a,59,A,262.98075,275.47525,12.4945,be a bad example like for example the Vi- Violent Femmes they've been around for a while and they've just started playing some new music of theirs and it made me go out and buy some and listen to it i won't say i like the whole album really but uh ,1,0
sw2923A-ms98-a,64,A,312.83425,321.216125,8.381875,the only thing i like about Madonna is i think if if i was given a ticket to see her perform i think she'd be entertaining to see perform,1,0
sw2923A-ms98-a,66,A,331.708375,336.061625,4.35325,but i do think if someone gave me a ticket it'd be a really entertaining show,1,0
sw2923B-ms98-a,18,B,71.46675,78.722375,7.255625,yeah it's noi- it just doesn't seem like it was supposed to be played at the same time together or that someone isn't tuned or whatever,1,0
sw2923B-ms98-a,36,B,129.2695,135.3415,6.072,oh don't be silly i used to play the piano and i used to play the guitar but,1,0
sw2923B-ms98-a,37,B,135.3415,146.7685,11.427,then when i moved out you don't get to take the piano with you and uh there- no guitar around so i decided just to turn on the radio and that'll be my musical entertainment from now on,1,0
sw2924A-ms98-a,18,A,62.16875,66.02475,3.856,right so he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence in some cases there,1,0
sw2924A-ms98-a,28,A,98.569125,107.05675,8.487625,someone says to you you know when they ask you if you uh if you want to be on you know when you're c- called for duty say oh yeah i want to be on jury duty because i can spot a guilty person a mile a way,2,0
sw2924A-ms98-a,33,A,134.93,137.95175,3.02175,i believe it does have to be unanimous actually,1,0
sw2924A-ms98-a,45,A,186.131,196.92025,10.78925,i wonder about those things you know or even if it's you know i i- guess if they were to say well it doesn't have to be unanimous what's the cut off number seven five you know six six you know how do you decide,1,0
sw2924A-ms98-a,65,A,281.730875,289.8395,8.108625,yeah w- so i wond- and then i wonder why that you know there there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that you you know something like,1,0
sw2924A-ms98-a,66,A,289.8395,296.75,6.9105,something like well you can't be tried for the same trial because that would bias the the the the the the jury or something or you know,1,0
sw2924A-ms98-a,88,A,382.342,386.0335,3.6915,then they should be closed yeah i mean that's what i think but i don't um,1,0
sw2924A-ms98-a,105,A,453.3325,464.8795,11.547,i mean that's even a- another issue you know should should should judges be appointed you know and or or um often times i look at friends we had uh a serial killer around here who killed eleven women,1,0
sw2924A-ms98-a,131,A,553.99775,559.12175,5.124,i mean it's clear to me the man is insane and should just be locked up for life,1,0
sw2924A-ms98-a,135,A,576.276125,582.013125,5.737,to sort look at it you know i mean i don't think it's feasible but it would be an interesting thought if you're,1,0
sw2924B-ms98-a,22,B,54.1915,64.080125,9.888625,the general public doesn't know that if i- if they're sentenced to life that they won't serve life of course the judge will know when he'll be up for parole and all that so yeah,1,0
sw2924B-ms98-a,37,B,133.934625,137.145,3.210375,does it have to be unanimous,1,0
sw2924B-ms98-a,45,B,161.494625,167.132375,5.63775,well you don't have to be really convinced that he's guilty it's just if they can't prove he's guilty because,1,0
sw2924B-ms98-a,49,B,171.86975,176.843625,4.973875,i would hate to be that person because you would be uh,2,0
sw2924B-ms98-a,61,B,222.2355,234.196125,11.960625,well how they'll you know the through the whole movie you think this person's i don't know but one thing that i thought was pretty weird is how somebody can't be trialed tried trie- uh excuse me twice for the same crime,1,0
sw2924B-ms98-a,64,B,248.279375,263.221125,14.94175,set it up where it looked like somebody was trying to frame him and he was on trial for it and then you know it came out that he was being framed so then he was found not guilty and then jus- directly after the trial they found out he really was guilty and he couldn't be tried again,1,0
sw2924B-ms98-a,78,B,335.6785,340.7735,5.095,yeah i know if it's related if it's related to the crime they should be able to,1,0
sw2924B-ms98-a,91,B,388.031375,394.693875,6.6625,tell you what we need to do is go into law and then we'll be able to or vote do you vote  yeah do you vote,1,0
sw2924B-ms98-a,93,B,398.1265,410.827,12.7005,putting the right people in the office that's a lot to do with it too a lot uh a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the um general public wants so they'll be revoted and all that,1,0
sw2924B-ms98-a,123,B,526.707125,541.40675,14.699625,so yeah i i'm i was up north  but uh that's one of the reasons i think judges should be the ones to sentence people because they do know you know if you sentence them to three life times then they probably won't get out on parole,1,0
sw2924B-ms98-a,127,B,555.761875,560.0855,4.323625,well of course but they need to do something with him he needs to be annihilated ,1,0
sw2924B-ms98-a,131,B,580.7395,588.83975,8.10025,well it's supposed to be a jury of your peers they couldn't have a a bunch of psychotics up there ,1,0
sw2925A-ms98-a,16,A,69.4265,82.160375,12.733875,b- be able to find a way to get the guns but i think in a lot of domestic  uh disputes and a lot of family disputes um i'm not sure that those people would be able to get a hold of the guns,2,0
sw2925A-ms98-a,30,A,136.638875,145.60525,8.966375,you know be able to pull the trigger in the end and i guess i always thought if it was threatening my personal safety or especially like my kids you know,1,0
sw2925A-ms98-a,74,A,283.4535,295.796375,12.342875,holy smoke that's wild i was ta- again i was talking with somebody just last week and a- about crime in general i guess it's been on the news a lot lately and i g- must be in the back of everybody's mind but i was saying,1,0
sw2925A-ms98-a,86,A,333.078375,347.07475,13.996375,yeah well i can see how that might be now i mean you don't have to answer this or not if you don't want to because_1 i know it's a personal thing but with the crime that your family was involved in wa- was there were there guns involved in that,1,0
sw2925A-ms98-a,130,A,472.188125,479.238375,7.05025,in a separate location and they are just in there indefinitely they don't have any time when they are going to be released,1,0
sw2925A-ms98-a,157,A,560.961625,565.36725,4.405625,w- i don't feel that's true anymore they're not going to be able to handle it,1,0
sw2925A-ms98-a,165,A,584.505375,588.1555,3.650125,wow that w- that would be hard to understand,1,0
sw2925B-ms98-a,7,B,31.162875,35.544125,4.38125,i wouldn't be f- against control if it,1,0
sw2925B-ms98-a,30,B,167.738125,182.26625,14.528125,but i think there are certain cases where it could get you in trouble you have to be able to know when it when it can and when it can't if it came in the middle of the night where if i could get my hands on it and do something with it that's one thing uh,1,0
sw2925B-ms98-a,37,B,255.6965,261.31775,5.62125,but they won't be there long and and we we've had to deal you know we've had to deal with a lot of that and,1,0
sw2925B-ms98-a,40,B,282.51075,285.451,2.94025,whether it be just normal robbery or whatever,1,0
sw2925B-ms98-a,67,B,397.388375,403.9755,6.587125,but yet you know he'll like i say he'll be back out on the street just because of this this new you know uh,1,0
sw2925B-ms98-a,82,B,493.28475,506.070875,12.786125,i and that and and i hate to say that but i- i mean it's it's just you they they violate your family of course at that point you don't have much to lose and i ha- and i- like i said i really hate to say that but i think that i would be that uh taken buy it ,1,0
sw2925B-ms98-a,89,B,532.959375,544.1805,11.221125,and that that's really a shame but as far you know but as far as gun control goes i think that there n- there definitely needs to be some measures taken because_1 not everybody's capable of own- of owning and and taking care of a weapon,1,0
sw2926A-ms98-a,6,A,32.546125,47.477625,14.9315,don't seem to be able to produce the students that ind- indeed many uh manufacturing and other enterprises want they can't seem to they can't seem to read properly do math properly and conform to what employers want,1,0
sw2926A-ms98-a,25,A,135.105,144.327875,9.222875,yeah that yeah that must be an inner school i just read a an amazing article i guess in this month's New this week's New Yorker about Baltimore ,1,0
sw2926A-ms98-a,30,A,188.6885,199.66825,10.97975,and that school children uh a- are not far off that mark with six point eight now i don't know what school children what year that is i mean that's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube,1,0
sw2926A-ms98-a,38,A,224.69875,235.373875,10.675125,rural or poorer inner city schools these kids go to a f- they live in a fairly nice upper scale neighborhood and they seem to be doing extraordinarily well i- i- i mean i quiz them and i talk to them and they,1,0
sw2926A-ms98-a,42,A,245.17675,248.804625,3.627875,yeah that that that that could be very well true,1,0
sw2926A-ms98-a,55,A,299.286,307.334125,8.048125,and i- i- i think that could that's a formula that could be applied everywhere except it must cost a heck of a lot of money if you  it in public school ,1,0
sw2926A-ms98-a,65,A,326.678625,339.992,13.313375,well that that that's that that must be then then if that's uh i think we both agree on that then then then then a parent parental involvement has to be there and i guess you got to take them away from the tube also another thing that i have another,2,0
sw2926A-ms98-a,67,A,345.283125,357.3335,12.050375,incredible at least in the high school and college level emphasis on sports where enormous amounts of money are spent and it seems to me that mo- money could be more well well spent somewhere else,1,0
sw2926A-ms98-a,98,A,438.70825,446.49825,7.79,well i- i never thought of that benefit but the consequence then i my i guess what i'd have to say about that is there can only be one ,1,0
sw2926A-ms98-a,121,A,533.491875,543.35275,9.860875,so it had to be it had to be where they could put it in one segment and g- and and i guess capture the whole thing for some sponsor,2,0
sw2926B-ms98-a,52,B,259.410125,264.758125,5.348,you know what the parents are going to be like when they come in and the responses the parents will give back oh yeah,1,0
sw2926B-ms98-a,96,B,485.9635,495.028375,9.064875,so i would assume distance swimming might be similar that and he was good at distance splits as a swimmer you know at i can remember that but the distance um ,1,0
sw2927A-ms98-a,26,A,124.0035,131.086,7.0825,it's like going to Ar- well probably what you Arizona used to be like you know it's just dry and cool so it's not it's not what you think it is,1,0
sw2927B-ms98-a,2,B,2.926625,8.143,5.216375,oh boy this is gonna be tough i'm in Plano ,1,0
sw2927B-ms98-a,58,B,185.009125,188.915125,3.906,my parents just live uh thirty miles south of Denver and it can be sunny and,1,0
sw2927B-ms98-a,59,B,188.915125,191.980875,3.06575,and no problem in Denver and they'll be having snow,1,0
sw2927B-ms98-a,61,B,193.068375,196.347375,3.279,so it's pretty amazing it can be that drastic in just a short distance,1,0
sw2927B-ms98-a,64,B,198.928625,203.290625,4.362,uh it's getting to be more and more of a possibility,1,0
sw2927B-ms98-a,65,B,203.290625,211.224125,7.9335,it used to be no problem just because it was such a a rugged terrain and with trees everywhere but now as they start to clear more things out,1,0
sw2928A-ms98-a,9,A,65.53325,73.125625,7.592375,so they've made it uh they've made it convenient it used to be if you wanted to recycle you had to drive to a uh,1,0
sw2928A-ms98-a,25,A,206.7065,219.924875,13.218375,that that i'd like to bring up and that is whether it's the function of government to do the recycling rather than the individual consumer and i guess my opinion would be that that's maybe one of the few,1,0
sw2928A-ms98-a,39,A,344.086625,354.332,10.245375,sort of uh high tech uh uh uh trash collector trucks they're big things too they must be as long as at least as long as a school bus,1,0
sw2928B-ms98-a,22,B,107.875125,116.877,9.001875,unfortunately while the responsibility should be on the consumer it will be placed on the cities now,2,0
sw2928B-ms98-a,29,B,159.284875,170.21725,10.932375,because it's there on the store's property and it's on a it's on con- it's on you know asphalt and there's huge trash bins but there may be some unsightly  creatures running around,1,0
sw2928B-ms98-a,41,B,246.624125,251.357,4.732875,the the convenience a- and the burden would have to be placed,1,0
sw2928B-ms98-a,42,B,251.357,262.098375,10.741375,on someone other than the consumer because the consumer just won't do it so if if government should do it you know somebody's got to do it and if if anybody it should be the government,1,0
sw2928B-ms98-a,43,B,262.098375,269.64475,7.546375,but you know ultimately it should be the responsibility of the consumer but that just won't happen it's unrealistic so uh,1,0
sw2929A-ms98-a,7,A,24.073625,27.107125,3.0335,uh-huh you you would be in favor of it,1,0
sw2929A-ms98-a,132,A,453.885,459.671875,5.786875,they uh they just don't seem to be i know they're making progress but not like,1,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,3,B,3.37225,13.3295,9.95725,well i believe that the um the voice that uh initialized this call asked about uh if we thought that it should be something that,1,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,4,B,13.3295,15.7675,2.438,should be put into action,1,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,6,B,21.02325,24.739,3.71575,yes i i i i would be committed to that,1,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,23,B,96.996125,102.117625,5.1215,oh absolutely that the choice would be yours yes if you felt that you weren't being,1,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,25,B,106.388625,110.878625,4.49,that you should be able to make um a choice there,1,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,37,B,183.655125,189.134,5.478875,but those guidelines have to be set up and i think they should be voted on by the public,2,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,41,B,195.03275,200.574125,5.541375,and of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be and,1,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,53,B,235.58075,241.24,5.65925,the eyes and the ears and the uh whole self should be uh,1,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,54,B,241.24,252.357125,11.117125,uh included in all of that uh dental eye care and uh  our body as a whole should be included in that because,1,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,55,B,252.357125,257.295125,4.938,there's so many avenues that needs to be um,1,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,59,B,266.32725,270.16925,3.842,anything and not be covered by the program,1,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,72,B,320.31725,326.253875,5.936625,so but i i would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something,1,0
sw2929B-ms98-a,132,B,522.969875,528.00375,5.033875,well you do the same and uh we'll be t- i guess talking around the country,1,0
sw2930A-ms98-a,62,A,218.24375,223.99525,5.7515,oh don't be concerned there's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere,1,0
sw2931A-ms98-a,18,A,75.35725,80.447125,5.089875,that's is a tremendous burden to be working and have two kids to take care of,1,0
sw2931A-ms98-a,49,A,219.33525,231.026875,11.691625,and support her and that was something my parents weren't able to do and i resented that because i would be in i was always in plays in high school and in all kinds of drama and they could never come and watch me and that just,1,0
sw2931A-ms98-a,50,A,231.026875,237.41175,6.384875,it was so hard for me so i made a vow that when i had kids no matter what they did i was going to be there you know,1,0
sw2931A-ms98-a,86,A,388.514375,396.2025,7.688125,they don't want to be with their kids all day  and and that's hard for me because to me they're giving up something so precious you know and um,1,0
sw2931A-ms98-a,87,A,396.2025,402.219625,6.017125,so any time we talk get on that topic i have to be real careful because i'm afraid i'll say something to offend them ,1,0
sw2931A-ms98-a,89,A,408.287375,415.3255,7.038125,yeah it is i don't know how long everybody will be able to afford to keep doing it  but if,1,0
sw2931B-ms98-a,9,B,44.079,52.6835,8.6045,then it it drastically changed uh be- prior to that we had sit down dinners and we talked and we did a whole lot of things and then when he left,1,0
sw2931B-ms98-a,69,B,447.523375,451.472875,3.9495,okay the hours are at least to be home you know,1,0
sw2931B-ms98-a,74,B,479.2195,487.58525,8.36575,well maybe now that you've had your own children you'll like to be around little children or have a litt- little better tolerance,1,0
sw2931B-ms98-a,76,B,491.686,493.637125,1.951125,that'd be tough yeah,1,0
sw2932A-ms98-a,18,A,102.5485,106.84425,4.29575,you know how realtors are they'll say oh this could be five bedrooms,1,0
sw2932A-ms98-a,19,A,106.84425,112.272125,5.427875,yeah if you had two people that don't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house don't need a closet,1,0
sw2933A-ms98-a,14,A,74.276375,80.5615,6.285125,right yeah my husband has good benefits too or i probably wouldn't be able to do the temporary work,1,0
sw2933A-ms98-a,22,A,124.243625,132.825125,8.5815,yeah those must be pretty good benefits i've heard that usually they average about thirty percent of your salary so it sounds like maybe his company's a little bit better,1,0
sw2933A-ms98-a,37,A,239.969,248.304,8.335,won't let them_1 stay any longer it frustrates him because they'll just be getting somebody to the point where they can really make some progress and then they're gone,1,0
sw2933B-ms98-a,27,B,112.547,124.490375,11.943375,and uh all of those things now some of those you look at and you say well i'm not going to need that or use that benefit but i guess it's there knowing that it could be used if you,1,0
sw2933B-ms98-a,34,B,150.734375,158.6185,7.884125,how they're going to match up and it might be wise to take a lower salary or hourly wage,1,0
sw2933B-ms98-a,45,B,196.3405,209.39125,13.05075,we're in a different one now than we used to be and it's required some adjustment but i think it in the end it will all come out in the wash their uh mental health benefits are very very low,1,0
sw2933B-ms98-a,46,B,209.39125,219.61625,10.225,and anything that is elective of in any way could possibly be conceived as elective is you know not covered so,1,0
sw2933B-ms98-a,59,B,265.80125,276.6735,10.87225,you know the best good was not gleaned from the   where as maybe even two weeks longer would have made a difference there should be some provision for appeal or something i guess,1,0
sw2933B-ms98-a,72,B,334.015625,341.954375,7.93875,no i don't think so i think there're going to be too many of us our age for any way that that system can possibly,1,0
sw2933B-ms98-a,73,B,341.954375,350.32475,8.370375,even barely lessen the load we just better be those of us who can try to do something anything to put away for,1,0
sw2934A-ms98-a,79,A,417.496,428.29525,10.79925,yeah you'd be amazed at how clear the sky was but the clouds are just really uh uh rolling kind of just real pillowy i guess,1,0
sw2935B-ms98-a,8,B,37.266375,48.9455,11.679125,you know so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here and uh if you really water a lot you can do it but you know when you have to pay for water it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly,1,0
sw2935B-ms98-a,23,B,99.777125,102.556375,2.77925,if you don't have a frost you'll be all ,1,0
sw2935B-ms98-a,36,B,160.951,171.43875,10.48775, and uh i- i was in England once and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had they had a beautiful garden in it you know it could be three feet by four feet or something,1,0
sw2935B-ms98-a,45,B,218.307625,225.289625,6.982,see you really really have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer people that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation,1,0
sw2935B-ms98-a,65,B,312.399,314.599875,2.200875,so i think it will be fun for them,1,0
sw2935B-ms98-a,75,B,350.508375,354.156,3.647625,we use to didn't eat them_1 i mean i guess i could be thankful for that,1,0

sw2954A-ms98-a,66,A,195.693375,198.10925,2.415875,that's for sure the cleaning up can be a mess,1,0
sw2954A-ms98-a,90,A,259.843,264.8475,5.0045,i do not know how they do scale down there you know here it would be a  amount of ,1,0

sw2954A-ms98-a,155,A,498.538125,502.241125,3.703,but i've never seen them_1 just alive someplace that would be fun to see,1,0
sw2954B-ms98-a,30,B,92.8255,96.8,3.9745,the the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be,1,0
sw2954B-ms98-a,155,B,527.58375,533.83375,6.25,from the time they they stay slender until they get to be uh eighteen inches long and then they start to widen out ,1,0
sw2955A-ms98-a,40,A,214.8255,226.229125,11.403625,you know most of them are very very strongly that that the reason for America to be there was a good one they just felt that the way America backed them up wasn't wasn't at all right,1,0
sw2955B-ms98-a,38,B,180.01725,184.495875,4.478625,my main opinion would be  we shouldn't have done it ,1,0
sw2956A-ms98-a,7,A,48.45775,62.299125,13.841375,most people uh a great number of people now work at various at different jobs that if a third of the people are shift workers they won't be able to get to the to the polls in any case if they uh have to work late into the evening and not get up,1,0
sw2956A-ms98-a,28,A,235.265,243.95,8.685,and it's not refuted people will you know uh believe it if you don't refute it as he didn't that that there must be some truth to the matter see ,1,0
sw2956A-ms98-a,39,A,295.582,306.870375,11.288375,you know y-  it could be c- convoluted in many ways where people would actually uh by paying them i mean you know you take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever,1,0
sw2956A-ms98-a,40,A,306.870375,314.005875,7.1355,but that it would be very difficult to administer because i'm sure that any time money and votes are involved   the whole thing just stinks,1,0
sw2956A-ms98-a,49,A,401.489,415.16475,13.67575,he should address those problems and if there needs to be a change in a period of time why what was so funny about it is that i guess that it happened so rapidly you know he knew it he actually knew it and being associated with government he should be held up to the light for that and maybe he will,2,0
sw2956A-ms98-a,52,A,419.2895,431.12175,11.83225,you still have a view that the American voter is different from other voters and he's motivated because we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that i think voters are motivated uh,1,0
sw2956B-ms98-a,95,B,435.85,439.906375,4.056375,and well the newer democracies because_1 it's going to be totally different but,1,0
sw2957A-ms98-a,17,A,97.77675,105.70175,7.925,that's right that's right and you know i mean i was thinking it just you know my complaint would would be um that i think that,1,0
sw2957A-ms98-a,36,A,187.729875,201.98725,14.257375,hundred percent i guess i was lucky because_1 i was teaching and so i was able to just go to a class and teach when my son was little and so i'd be gone you know an hour and fifteen minutes or something at a stretch,1,0
sw2957A-ms98-a,55,A,313.497375,323.487625,9.99025,do the   so i- i guess you're right it's it's our society demands women to work if they're going to be respected,1,0
sw2957A-ms98-a,63,A,370.485125,375.950625,5.4655,um-hum so that might be of a positive change in society,1,0
sw2957B-ms98-a,11,B,55.496375,57.999375,2.503,to be able to do that,1,0
sw2957B-ms98-a,16,B,70.999,81.276125,10.277125,it's it's not easy to do at all i mean there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the if the wife is going to actually be a mother,2,0
sw2957B-ms98-a,18,B,94.465875,98.999125,4.53325,um-hum i think that that they're  well they have to be related ,1,0
sw2957B-ms98-a,28,B,167.925,176.73475,8.80975,it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care,1,0
sw2957B-ms98-a,46,B,276.12525,280.6445,4.51925,i don't see how they could be especially not if they have to pay for child care,1,0
sw2957B-ms98-a,48,B,293.49725,302.57675,9.0795,um-hum you're probably right if she sat down and looked at it she'd be like God what am i doing this for you know,1,0
sw2958A-ms98-a,71,A,469.86425,473.9075,4.04325,they'll be abused but you hear horror stories all the time,1,0
sw2958B-ms98-a,6,B,27.405625,39.540375,12.13475,and the elderly people that i  that are still hanging onto their homes that is their greatest fear is to be put into a a a care facility rather than their families taking them in,1,0
sw2958B-ms98-a,8,B,43.855625,56.131125,12.2755,but if that is the case that they have to go to a care facility like that i think that care facility has to be thoroughly investigated as far as the uh medical um,1,0
sw2959A-ms98-a,100,A,517.691125,527.4785,9.787375,and he just he didn't want to be in it any more than than what we started out in August with Desert Storm and then it just blew up into the war,1,0
sw2959B-ms98-a,39,B,184.310375,192.82325,8.512875,lot of people have complained in the schools there is a culture change there the southeast Asians seem to be very hungry there seem to be very studious ,2,0
sw2959B-ms98-a,43,B,218.125,228.51125,10.38625,might be going to to some of these people here and that is all a result of of of Vietnam and and you see a lot of a lot of men that were over there brought families back,1,0
sw2959B-ms98-a,44,B,228.51125,239.641,11.12975,uh and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there and i'd be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now,1,0
sw2959B-ms98-a,52,B,269.751125,272.49775,2.746625,that'd be an interesting concept,1,0
sw2959B-ms98-a,105,B,488.744625,498.984375,10.23975,but i sure can't blame them for being angry on the other hand you know you can be angry about something for a very long time or you can say well that is the way it is and go on with your life,1,0
sw2960A-ms98-a,16,A,42.167625,55.3375,13.169875,yeah it can be very educational there are shows th- that i like uh i like good family shows uh though uh i let my kids watch things like Little House On The Prairie,1,0
sw2960A-ms98-a,48,A,177.2825,182.349625,5.067125,if there starts to be a lot of violence i do not go for that ,1,0
sw2960B-ms98-a,105,B,411.455875,421.08975,9.633875,idol  when i was growing up because i am twenty seven so it is you know she is about the same age as i am i wanted to be just like her because she is so cute,1,0
sw2961A-ms98-a,26,A,182.347375,189.4675,7.120125,you know that whi- which amazes me um i i you know it never occurred to me how expensive that sort of thing can be,1,0
sw2961A-ms98-a,37,A,261.354625,273.950375,12.59575,you sort of get away for a while too we have i don't i don't um it's strange it's funny that i should get this particular we should be on this topic now because uh because we have even though we have no kids we have people staying with us,1,0
sw2961A-ms98-a,60,A,470.92925,475.520625,4.591375,wi- especially when there are ten of them floating around and you're supposed to be running around teaching them things and,1,0
sw2961B-ms98-a,5,B,22.656875,36.240375,13.5835,i don't know if i had it to do it over again maybe i would be a little more selective and really you know find out more about them_1 i think the main thing was that i needed someone to take care of my children and i and i generally used some place that was either,1,0
sw2961B-ms98-a,7,B,50.63975,61.545125,10.905375,uh i don't know if it would be different now you know i hear i hear i know a lot of uh mothers or uh people that i work with and they are you know putting their children in different places,1,0
sw2961B-ms98-a,18,B,97.18575,109.334,12.14825,child care center for the Summer because they have so much more structured time and they offer different classes like her daughter's going to be taking gymnastics and she said if she had left her where that she was,1,0
sw2961B-ms98-a,19,B,109.334,116.711375,7.377375,uh previously that a lot of time would you know just be free time for them to do whatever they wanted do and a lot of times they get bored so,1,0
sw2961B-ms98-a,23,B,131.912875,145.834875,13.922,and i guess the ratio of of workers to children you know would be something to consider uh especially if they're little bitty children that would be a i wou- i i would hate to leave an uh a real small baby you know,2,0
sw2961B-ms98-a,34,B,202.0975,216.29625,14.19875,it's something a fill- fulfilling a- another need i suppose than staying home with with children all the time but that's a tough deal to do too too you know but uh it'd be nice to,1,0
sw2961B-ms98-a,36,B,219.34475,233.208875,13.864125,i don't know i don't know a good solution to that but but it's it's tough to be i s- i started to say stuck at home with children all the time and never getting  that that's just probably not a real good way to put it,1,0
sw2961B-ms98-a,37,B,233.208875,241.23425,8.025375,but some people you know they their their life and children can be a full time job and you don't have time for anything else so you,1,0
sw2962A-ms98-a,3,A,8.97075,22.415125,13.444375,uh stronger that the jury system should be changed it seems to have worked uh uh time immemorial and when uh difficult decisions uh are made uh uh uh they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on,2,0
sw2962A-ms98-a,8,A,45.96675,50.8535,4.88675,i think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing simply because,1,0
sw2962A-ms98-a,9,A,50.8535,62.1015,11.248,uh there's always uh there's there's always a jury that might be  uh by the moment uh to either be too lenient or too vengeful i guess,2,0
sw2962A-ms98-a,14,A,81.80625,92.0075,10.20125,hundred year sentences and the people in various states it doesn't seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons or even in for that matter,1,0
sw2962A-ms98-a,18,A,106.668375,110.751875,4.0835,yeah you know that might be it i mean they they certainly,1,0
sw2962A-ms98-a,23,A,144.905,156.11025,11.20525,so uh yeah you might be right about that i i i do not know it just seems to me that only about uh from what i read only about ninety percent of the ca- only about ten percent of the  cases come for trial anyway,1,0
sw2962A-ms98-a,27,A,180.808625,192.507125,11.6985,but uh uh how do you feel about the about the jury system itself do you you think that should be changed or do do you know in Virginia whether it's if they have smaller juries or,1,0
sw2962A-ms98-a,35,A,226.3745,237.345375,10.970875,are are uh a- are the results of some sort of a uh an action that you're bringing against someone else you can ask for that to be heard before a jury takes a heck of a long time i guess to get there,1,0
sw2962A-ms98-a,49,A,330.238875,334.478375,4.2395,well there must be a a  a a a very great degree of that but,1,0
sw2962A-ms98-a,52,A,352.969125,362.27525,9.306125,that that when a jury makes a decision they shouldn't be asked uh before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision i mean i don't,1,0
sw2962A-ms98-a,68,A,447.919375,449.3705,1.451125, that might be it,1,0

sw2962B-ms98-a,71,B,406.407875,412.65925,6.251375,you know i think uh no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be prosecuted ,1,0
sw2963A-ms98-a,8,A,19.717125,27.127875,7.41075,that will will be where it is uh if if she gets it planned i have been out of town so i do not know what she has been doing but uh,1,0
sw2963A-ms98-a,49,A,141.602125,153.505,11.902875,well we need to have another one i hope my aunt is successful as uh later well it is probably not going to be done because i have not heard from them i it was supposed to be this June so i don't imagine there is anything coming this is hardly almost June,2,0
sw2963B-ms98-a,4,B,9.50925,12.913,3.40375,oh that will be fun if you haven't done it in a while,1,0
sw2963B-ms98-a,31,B,96.0535,102.07025,6.01675,we are just scattered all over the place so it is going to be hard this time but we have got a huge family,1,0
sw2963B-ms98-a,81,B,322.127125,324.949875,2.82275,uh i won't be adding any more to the family  ,1,0
sw2964A-ms98-a,60,A,299.783875,303.654625,3.87075,it gives them a foothold to to be against somebody else,1,0

sw2964A-ms98-a,83,A,412.771,422.883,10.112,and and more and more of that kind of thing happens i mean can you imagine i mean it used to be like with the dapper bandit is one guy you know,1,0
sw2964A-ms98-a,86,A,432.44725,446.153375,13.706125,one of the things that he did is is um any counter top that was there up to maybe like four feet high he could vertical jump on top of the counter top and and jump down and and be,1,0
sw2964B-ms98-a,5,B,10.512875,20.581,10.068125,i guess i am probably closer to a ten than a one i be- i am uh i am not opposed at all to having a waiting period for you know for the purchase of guns,1,0
sw2964B-ms98-a,11,B,61.415125,71.861125,10.446,yeah i- i- i uh i agree with that uh although i can i can see where there might be even be a a potential uh sometime you  a need sometime in the future for the individuals to have,2,0

sw2967B-ms98-a,37,B,165.545125,175.88975,10.344625,because it really was good even though it is such a long movie you know they said oh people won't won't be interested in a three hour movie but it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone,1,0

sw2970A-ms98-a,122,A,594.461625,598.7915,4.329875,yeah it seems like a crime is turning into a pastime instead of like you know be,1,0
sw2970B-ms98-a,26,B,89.101625,98.939125,9.8375,yeah it really does and if you're a little bit claustrophobic but uh i don't know i mean the jails are crowded i- i i'm not a criminal justice specialist so i don't know what you know what can be done i'm,1,0
sw2970B-ms98-a,65,B,287.7955,293.51575,5.72025,i mean that is are you going to be a career person i'm digressing but  i don't talk to many people in the military so i am,1,0
sw2973A-ms98-a,70,A,294.96425,303.879125,8.914875,we we do tend to eat out at least once a week sometimes more although with two sons in college now that may be it may be a  ,2,0
sw2973B-ms98-a,51,B,329.835125,343.251,13.415875,yeah we- that's what's really great about where i live here it's in in an area that's within you know four or five blocks there must be forty restaurants i'm not kidding it's just uh,1,0
sw2978A-ms98-a,75,A,365.334,373.1755,7.8415,well yes uh anytime there's a storm there's going to be plenty of it yeah one of the,1,0
sw2978A-ms98-a,84,A,405.763125,419.523,13.759875,well i am a little bit concerned this last week our temperatures not drop down below the upper seventies at night which means that y- you know we could be looking for a very warm Summer i really don't want that ,1,0
sw2978B-ms98-a,18,B,112.58425,123.00075,10.4165,again maybe get some cool weather but uh i don't know uh i- it doesn't look very  because they're calling for the rest of the week to be equally as hot so,1,0
sw2978B-ms98-a,38,B,239.7225,253.50825,13.78575,snow two you know uh three to five inches all the time or q- quite often they seem to be able to handle it when they have it like that but here uh the schools close when there's half an inch of snow  and uh,1,0
sw2979A-ms98-a,14,A,91.004,105.9175,14.9135,the outspoken people people who make a difference and make a change that age has come down it seems like uh you can make a difference at a younger age these days you don't have to be a an older part of the establishment to make waves,1,0
sw2979A-ms98-a,19,A,129.34625,139.72875,10.3825,plus there seems to be uh uh there's a few negative changes that have come along i was just thinking last night how different uh my kids' childhood is from uh,1,0
sw2979A-ms98-a,25,A,186.651125,195.75825,9.107125,i've got a nine year old and a seven year old and uh they both like to ride their bikes off into never never land and you know be,1,0
sw2979A-ms98-a,31,A,219.556375,231.738875,12.1825,ten twelve miles away we'd spend a whole day just two or three of us get together and take a lunch and go ride somewhere and eat lunch and come back and you know as long as we told the parents what roads we were going to be on and if there any,1,0
sw2979A-ms98-a,38,A,262.509625,270.4065,7.896875,you know they they're saying that the uh uh the education is going to be enough or at least a major part of the drug ,1,0
sw2979A-ms98-a,64,A,398.82,412.3385,13.5185,of course there you wouldn't be able to go over and attack them but i don't know that they'd be able to go anywhere and attack us  they can't get all those people across the sea they don't have the ships to get them_1 anywhere so they may have a huge army but it's going to stay put,2,0
sw2979B-ms98-a,32,B,197.297375,200.023,2.725625,well i guess it would be a city block,1,0
sw2980A-ms98-a,17,A,70.441125,73.685,3.243875,and will probably be pursuing it for a long time to come ,1,0
sw2980A-ms98-a,42,A,220.06625,231.3565,11.29025,and a place named Sonotek uh just to find out what their state of the art is and i see what's out there that can all be brought to bear on the problem ,1,0
sw2980A-ms98-a,45,A,247.68975,259.31725,11.6275,and uh so i think that's probably the way things will go in the future th- th- they'll start pulling together the different aspects of speech recognition i would say that there will be,1,0
sw2980A-ms98-a,46,A,259.31725,264.690625,5.373375,well there'll certainly be a lot of commercial products on the market in the next five years,1,0
sw2980A-ms98-a,47,A,264.690625,269.77975,5.089125,and there'll probably some be some very good systems available by the turn of the century,1,0
sw2980A-ms98-a,49,A,272.82975,277.04925,4.2195,yeah uh there'll probably be some,1,0
sw2980B-ms98-a,39,B,200.088625,203.4,3.311375,that wouldn't be a bad idea though do you think that,1,0
sw2980B-ms98-a,54,B,282.705375,285.63325,2.927875,it's going to be interesting to uh,1,0
sw2981A-ms98-a,10,A,49.773375,52.4995,2.726125,that might be true um,1,0
sw2981A-ms98-a,20,A,85.333625,95.226,9.892375,uh i have a a nine year old daughter and there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even considered capital crimes that,1,0
sw2981B-ms98-a,6,B,45.23875,48.868875,3.630125,maybe spend the money on someone who could possibly be helped,1,0
sw2981B-ms98-a,13,B,99.861875,112.883625,13.02175,yeah well that really gets int- into a sticky issue uh i could see that too i think there's probably things i could think of short of murder that someone i think someone would probably deserve to be killed for,1,0
sw2981B-ms98-a,14,B,112.883625,120.6075,7.723875,but gosh a- and who's going to decide which is how bad you know something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me and,1,0
sw2981B-ms98-a,35,B,258.699625,273.342,14.642375, yeah in general terms i'm not so harsh but then whenever i hear of a specific case you know where someone did something then i- it's like yeah put it to   so i i think i probably tend to be a little bit harsh too as far as that goes,1,0
sw2981B-ms98-a,61,B,432.88025,439.888875,7.008625,whatever is considered a minor i think the kids certain kids are have been tried as adults who were a lot younger than they used to be like,1,0
sw2982A-ms98-a,39,A,99.297625,106.37125,7.073625,and five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical too,1,0
sw2982A-ms98-a,60,A,170.459625,172.970375,2.51075,oh yeah should be,1,0
sw2982A-ms98-a,63,A,186.450875,199.677,13.226125,and it'd be much more convenient yeah it would be more convenient too um-hum oh yeah yeah my my other daughter works and has they have to take their two children to day care you know,2,0
sw2982A-ms98-a,102,A,328.04225,333.4105,5.36825,oh so they were very flexible and that that would be great yeah,1,0
sw2982A-ms98-a,105,A,337.2065,341.676625,4.470125,they say you're going to do it this way and that's the way it's going to be yeah,1,0
sw2982A-ms98-a,132,A,407.81675,417.907,10.09025,a co- con- consultant really is  should be more knowledgeable than everybody else  you know so it stands to reason they should really ha- have more benefits ,1,0
sw2982B-ms98-a,48,B,172.243375,182.35825,10.114875,so i was pretty shocked at that but the other thing that i'm really concerned about and most companies don't have some are starting to have is day care because it would be really nice to be able to have,2,0
sw2982B-ms98-a,49,B,182.35825,189.983,7.62475,you know someone that could watch my daughter at work and i'd go to work and if she were sick i could go down and see her if she needs to be fed whatever it is,1,0
sw2982B-ms98-a,51,B,191.46925,193.695125,2.225875,it would be more convenient more productive,1,0
sw2982B-ms98-a,58,B,212.891125,223.63375,10.742625,and that to me well that you know the those three things the health care vacation and day care are probably the most important benefits i should suppose i should be concerned with ,1,0
sw2982B-ms98-a,65,B,257.017125,264.735875,7.71875,you know everything else being equal because_1 your life would be so much easier and there's a question of quality of life also ,1,0
sw2982B-ms98-a,75,B,293.514,302.186375,8.672375,yeah because_1 Pittsburgh's a big enough city too but you know i wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones,1,0
sw2982B-ms98-a,76,B,302.186375,306.67625,4.489875,just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and,1,0
sw2982B-ms98-a,107,B,434.1905,447.56825,13.37775,get factored into somebody else's salary so really his salary should be you know twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that not including the fact that you know it's a less long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff,1,0
sw2983A-ms98-a,9,A,41.048625,53.688625,12.64,and he was really uh enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments he could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held and what the nature of the hole was and,1,0
sw2983A-ms98-a,13,A,62.203,72.62425,10.42125,but uh golf tended to be s- i am not really deeply involved in any following any of the sports,1,0
sw2983A-ms98-a,31,A,170.30625,177.183375,6.877125,and i know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier,1,0
sw2983A-ms98-a,40,A,213.832125,221.67775,7.845625,but it is a good healthy wholesome lifestyle a- uh anything can be warped,1,0
sw2983A-ms98-a,73,A,373.8415,387.102,13.2605,as a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if i thought i'd be interested in golf i said i don't know i'll have to try it and see i've always watched it and he said well fine he said we'll just take you over to the course he lives near Brookhaven,1,0
sw2983A-ms98-a,79,A,422.91825,425.41825,2.5,it doesn't appear to be ,1,0
sw2983B-ms98-a,4,B,12.701625,24.158625,11.457,uh-huh my husband likes golf also he's uh i guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it  but he he limits it pretty good i um,1,0
sw2985A-ms98-a,32,A,238.3345,243.693375,5.358875,uh i don't know if that's just my imagination or not but it seems to be that's uh,1,0
sw2985A-ms98-a,40,A,280.77625,284.081625,3.305375,uh there'll be more and more women that are up higher and higher,1,0
sw2985A-ms98-a,54,A,323.129625,328.208125,5.0785,it must be the culture's different uh down there than up here also,1,0
sw2985A-ms98-a,61,A,348.697125,356.681875,7.98475,you know uh ideas and or it seems like new ideas start out there and then kind of work their way east i don't know if you've found that to be true,1,0
sw2985B-ms98-a,6,B,20.732875,27.12925,6.396375,uh to sort of get married and raise children and uh be very domestic,1,0
sw2985B-ms98-a,20,B,103.553375,107.41025,3.856875,and very often the woman has to be able to earn a decent living,1,0
sw2985B-ms98-a,21,B,107.41025,112.76625,5.356,and uh so there's an additional reason for her to be capable of holding down a good job,1,0
sw2985B-ms98-a,34,B,209.039125,218.5325,9.493375,but uh uh you know there's no no no holding back their ambition on the other hand what it does to the fabric of society and the family remains to be seen,1,0
sw2985B-ms98-a,41,B,271.405,278.34775,6.94275,because there will be a precedent they'll have had role models whereas you know the generation that grew up in the sixties and seventies,1,0
sw2985B-ms98-a,48,B,308.23575,315.610125,7.374375,um i guess just by virtue of living longer in a way you're right because they do it d- does come to them but they've got to be young enough to enjoy it i mean if they're just,1,0
sw2985B-ms98-a,73,B,441.20175,446.83975,5.638,you know uh a little girl can say i want to be an astronaut or i want to be a fireman or a policeman or,2,0
sw2986A-ms98-a,62,A,259.420875,269.848625,10.42775,uh-huh about the only thing you do is is to provide the um protection in your own home and then be careful when you do go out at night if you go out at night ,1,0
sw2986B-ms98-a,22,B,61.6875,62.961,1.2735,yeah it used to be,1,0
sw2986B-ms98-a,28,B,106.629125,113.597,6.967875,uh-huh the murder rate really seems to be up in Fort Worth and Dallas well especially Dallas last year in Fort Worth this year,1,0
sw2987A-ms98-a,25,A,92.1675,97.107125,4.939625,it could be could be i don't uh use them_1 often enough to even keep tabs on it,2,0
sw2987A-ms98-a,97,A,406.113875,407.393875,1.28,could very well be,1,0
sw2987B-ms98-a,40,B,100.867875,107.5555,6.687625,and then you- then you're if you're that lucky you get to pay them another twenty five bucks a year just to be that privileged to get twenty one percent a year ,1,0
sw2988B-ms98-a,20,B,88.9485,92.921375,3.972875,they wouldn't be too much of a discipline problems i think if parents would um,1,0
sw2989A-ms98-a,11,A,64.267,75.58975,11.32275,to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to i think that's just part of their overall educational process is to get out and see and do things,1,0
sw2989A-ms98-a,26,A,146.514125,160.01575,13.501625, gone through that uh i remember my parents didn't do all those type things and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that and even now with my grandchildren i feel it's a very important thing to be done,1,0
sw2989A-ms98-a,33,A,188.507875,198.286375,9.7785,i was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to uh have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him,1,0
sw2989A-ms98-a,42,A,229.325,243.593125,14.268125,we've uh this is a very interesting program i i've heard about here on this and when i signed up for it it uh looked like it could be uh make a real contribution in in participating and uh,1,0
sw2990A-ms98-a,25,A,110.238375,124.164,13.925625,yeah i i might have been too old for the Beatles that might have been what it was  i was past that point when they came  uh but uh i i grew up uh listening to Elvis you know be- even before the Beatles so,1,0
sw2990B-ms98-a,103,B,435.162,449.878125,14.716125,i'll be washing dishes or something and i'll think about a song and it'll bring back you know some ideas and so to me it's just a good influence but there's still a whole lot of other music i you know really enjoy listening to my husband and i both kind of really got into REO S-,1,0
sw2991A-ms98-a,23,A,67.720625,75.179625,7.459,and you really have to be able to type pretty fast before you know before it it really saves time,1,0
sw2991B-ms98-a,16,B,76.170125,81.766875,5.59675,and you have to you know be familiar with the like there're so many different software packages,1,0
sw2991B-ms98-a,17,B,81.766875,85.811375,4.0445,i- you have to be familiar with the one that you're going to be using most,2,0
sw2991B-ms98-a,21,B,90.93025,103.886125,12.955875,know about half of the capabilities of a package that they should know to actually be able to use it properly and so they waste more time with their trying to uh,1,0
sw2991B-ms98-a,36,B,185.789,189.02475,3.23575,document and it may be eight pages long,1,0
sw2991B-ms98-a,49,B,254.652875,268.373,13.720125,they typeset they don't usually break words in a newspaper if the if one line is going to be a lot shorter than another line they just they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines,1,0
sw2991B-ms98-a,76,B,396.85175,402.4355,5.58375,too they don't have to necessarily be the IBM brand but they have to adhere to that industry standard,1,0
sw2992A-ms98-a,21,A,75.895625,88.231125,12.3355,oh that's true that's true well i noticed that my kids are uh older now they're uh getting close to the teenage years but they did we watched all of Mister Rogers and everything but even some of your uh cartoons can be very violent,1,0
sw2992A-ms98-a,23,A,95.72675,106.685,10.95825,and um uh i think it was on uh i have to remember which channel but anyway uh we were watching that and it was talking about opera and they showed like what they thought an opera would be and one of the things was to kill the rabbit kill the rabbit,1,0
sw2992A-ms98-a,24,A,106.685,117.538,10.853,and i thought oh how violent you know to kill the rabbit  so he ended up killing the rabbit in the end  uh but then of course the the rabbit comes back to life and says well see this is how an opera is supposed to be,1,0
sw2992A-ms98-a,25,A,117.538,123.747625,6.209625,and i thought gee whiz if a little kid was watching this you know that would be pretty violent even uh for a small child,1,0
sw2992B-ms98-a,18,B,59.554625,65.743,6.188375,it's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing you know not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff and they usually,1,0
sw2992B-ms98-a,20,B,70.51075,77.488,6.97725,my so- older son he's going to be five and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now so,1,0
sw2992B-ms98-a,67,B,305.353875,311.33375,5.979875,and especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings it's the only cool time to be ,1,0
sw2993A-ms98-a,19,A,96.405375,102.358,5.952625,and uh so uh i we're not going to be in the market for in the near future for any new car,1,0
sw2993A-ms98-a,20,A,102.358,109.56175,7.20375,but the the things that i would want would be a solid car another thing i'd definitely want would be antilock brakes,2,0
sw2993A-ms98-a,41,A,233.2435,245.43525,12.19175,yeah but or you know if you want to have open windows to be able to op- if you're alone in the car just to press buttons and but you know i've lived all these years without them i probably could have lived a little ,1,0
sw2993A-ms98-a,46,A,268.171875,282.81925,14.647375,and uh just so it'd be a good solid car i guess that's those are m- my major criteria everything else is you know a luxury and they make the car more expensive but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong,1,0
sw2993A-ms98-a,56,A,319.87075,331.83,11.95925,but once you get if you s- once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really and the parts i know the Audi parts are terribly expensive,1,0
sw2993A-ms98-a,71,A,383.3305,386.723875,3.393375,thank you you too it's going to be a hot one okay bye-bye,1,0
sw2994A-ms98-a,2,A,2.656,10.80625,8.15025,well a little bit we mostly do our newspapers we keep our newspapers and stuff like that and we take them to be recycled,1,0
sw2994A-ms98-a,31,A,139.846375,147.578,7.731625,that that might be a better way to do it and then people would would know that it was gonna cost them money to not sort their trash,1,0
sw2994A-ms98-a,33,A,150.407375,164.25,13.842625,you know because_1 then it would then it would make monetary sense to them you know to say hey you know if i just spend the time to to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then i don't have to pay for them_1 hauling it off,1,0
sw2994A-ms98-a,42,A,213.01075,215.929375,2.918625,it seems like they would be able to,1,0
sw2994B-ms98-a,21,B,96.332,99.91325,3.58125,yeah it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth,1,0
sw2994B-ms98-a,29,B,139.817625,142.027125,2.2095,yeah that'd be a good idea,1,0
sw2994B-ms98-a,33,B,148.08875,152.290375,4.201625,yeah that would be a real good motivation for people,1,0
sw2994B-ms98-a,40,B,184.07425,186.781625,2.707375,yeah that would be a real good idea,1,0
sw2994B-ms98-a,49,B,220.532125,230.727375,10.19525,i guess it just depends on how they   i don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff the center that their got now where you take your stuff in i th- i think that should be making some money,1,0
sw2995A-ms98-a,45,A,156.152,158.06375,1.91175,you can't force them to be,1,0
sw2995A-ms98-a,97,A,428.3475,437.8745,9.527,and it i guess it one of them is supposed to be a smokers survey but the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking,1,0
sw2995B-ms98-a,64,B,284.487375,286.987875,2.5005,i mean one should be sufficient,1,0
sw2995B-ms98-a,77,B,338.998,345.74175,6.74375,but if we were denied the right to call people up these people would never be able to get it,1,0
sw2996A-ms98-a,56,A,230.397875,244.339625,13.94175, that's true i tell you what hit me the first year i was here uh Christmas eve in New York there used to be stores open the department stores wouldn't close uh,1,0
sw2996B-ms98-a,4,B,9.596625,20.365375,10.76875,although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe there'll be a day that they're going to uh enact this i think uh,1,0
sw2996B-ms98-a,51,B,339.358375,353.363375,14.005,i mean you could always um uh be careful about that back then because uh you know if y- if a cop stopped you then you would um you know get arrested or whatnot and people would just drink openly,1,0
sw2997B-ms98-a,4,B,8.89325,21.127125,12.233875,three small ones okay_1 would you feel like those youngsters could be raised with a balanced life understanding all of the aspects of their lives if they did not perform some kind of public service,1,0
sw2997B-ms98-a,11,B,71.265,81.6115,10.3465,and serve as as a a a milit- in the military however they didn't say that it would be re- required to be two consecutive years what about the option,2,0
sw2997B-ms98-a,17,B,117.184125,119.351375,2.16725,well it would be like an elective,1,0
sw2997B-ms98-a,18,B,119.351375,125.272625,5.92125,it would be the equivalent of an elective do you want to serve in the Peace Corps or do you want serve uh  ,1,0
sw2997B-ms98-a,20,B,134.4525,138.58,4.1275,and it might be uh three hours a week that's what a class is ,1,0
sw2997B-ms98-a,26,B,192.064375,198.919875,6.8555,i'm very independent and i don't care much for that and i raised my children to be very independent,1,0
sw2997B-ms98-a,49,B,266.728125,272.813625,6.0855,in in a different respect and that's what i'm saying you don't have to go into the Peace Corps in order to be of of service to the community,1,0
sw2997B-ms98-a,65,B,326.6035,337.1375,10.534, y- i don't know the the benefit to you is much of greater value if you are physically or emotionally involved in what you're doing i- it's no big deal to be emotionally involved in writing a check ,1,0
sw2997B-ms98-a,67,B,341.48675,348.565,7.07825,and i think that's important and that's the reason that i think that there should be some provision even if it's not mandatory,1,0
sw2997B-ms98-a,80,B,389.0155,401.8845,12.869,you got to remember though the nature of the person we're  when we're involved with here you you can expect someone like that perhaps to be willing to volunteer to get expend the energy to go out and find,1,0
sw2997B-ms98-a,82,B,405.159125,417.117,11.957875,but it might be of interest to put in some sort of a formal system like they do the screening system in the military service okay you know what are your interests and what are your aptitudes let's see if we can match you to a job that you prefer,1,0
sw2997B-ms98-a,84,B,420.29325,430.6705,10.37725,i don't know that may or may not be uh a useful choice but i do know that there are a great deal of young people out there who would say why do i want to go,1,0
sw2998A-ms98-a,29,A,142.39775,148.61825,6.2205,that's right so solutions to this would be i- i you know improved,1,0
sw2998A-ms98-a,34,A,170.607125,183.34575,12.738625,that research really be directed toward um improvement of polluting vehicles and not just cars but also buses um  planes,1,0
sw2998A-ms98-a,35,A,183.34575,189.4075,6.06175,that something can be done i me- i can't imagine that well if we can't send people to the moon that we can't improve these ,1,0
sw2998A-ms98-a,68,A,317.26075,323.892125,6.631375,and the other will be going in September and we just feel that when we leave uh this area w- we're going north not south ,1,0
sw2998A-ms98-a,70,A,328.700875,331.227,2.526125,so i mean that's the way we will be going,1,0
sw2998A-ms98-a,71,A,331.227,339.47925,8.25225,but um so i- i i'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how they their attitudes are,1,0
sw2998B-ms98-a,4,B,12.56775,25.661125,13.093375,it's kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland but the major cause here and we always seem to and it seems to be validated by the press is the car pollution we don't have too much industrial pollution,1,0
sw2998B-ms98-a,5,B,25.661125,32.3745,6.713375,uh car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that that i can really put my finger on here,1,0
sw2998B-ms98-a,28,B,188.217625,200.678,12.460375,no i think that it can be done simply because uh uh we've we've every car now in America that's been produced for the past fifteen years has what they call a catalytic converter,1,0
sw2998B-ms98-a,41,B,283.5115,289.175625,5.664125, jump from whatever it was going to be from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be,2,0
sw2998B-ms98-a,58,B,345.92475,356.742875,10.818125,i mean i read that the other day i mean Louisi- Louisiana for a small state w- it was amazing but it's the industrial pollution i should imagine and California seems to be taking steps i mean,1,0
sw2999A-ms98-a,37,A,169.03125,171.57,2.53875,and i mean you can't do that it'd be ridiculous,1,0
sw2999A-ms98-a,74,A,310.98775,312.349125,1.361375,be ,1,0
sw2999A-ms98-a,79,A,327.5725,335.572375,7.999875,yeah and so that's easy enough to do and if that's true that's um i- it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit,1,0
sw2999A-ms98-a,102,A,426.736625,441.651,14.914375,or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be and so so that's you know another advantage and then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which um you hopefully you never use but like if your bagga- but things like if your baggage gets lost,1,0
sw2999B-ms98-a,3,B,2.36,16.348875,13.988875, yeah we well we have quite a few but we don't really use them_1 a lot we have well we like a lot of gasoline credit cards because_1 we like to be able to stop you know when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a station but as far as like MasterCard and Visa,1,0
sw2999B-ms98-a,84,B,326.0575,328.48575,2.42825, yeah that wouldn't be too hard to do ,1,0
sw2999B-ms98-a,88,B,338.83825,346.007875,7.169625,have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to be stuck with that we've never had that problem either,1,0
sw3000A-ms98-a,9,A,48.02075,59.164875,11.144125,that's good i never really thought about that but uh a good turn over would be sort of nice course if you find a place you like and you works out that no one else likes it would be sort of sad to see it go under ,2,0
sw3000A-ms98-a,11,A,73.775125,80.950375,7.17525,are they big into am- ambience down there or is it more like uh Texas to me makes it seems like it would be portions would be the  ,2,0
sw3000A-ms98-a,27,A,172.65975,181.962875,9.303125,the guy used to be the cook for the Capitol and so he stays in the same restaurant for twenty years you know and he's got a big clientele and um ,1,0
sw3000A-ms98-a,57,A,350.047125,359.417125,9.37,and uh that place is known for the the rudest waitresses in the country are are at the Vienna Inn and uh people go there to be abused i mean,1,0
sw3000A-ms98-a,58,A,359.417125,365.59775,6.180625,you actually go in there to be abused by the by the waitresses and the bartenders and stuff,1,0
sw3000B-ms98-a,42,B,287.386625,299.7375,12.350875,and uh it's really in fact we do a lot more entertaining i think at home than we do going out so when we do go out we really you know want to be wowed by um the presentation   speak,1,0
sw3000B-ms98-a,56,B,357.95275,360.69325,2.7405,just to be abused by the meanest waitress,1,0
sw3001A-ms98-a,71,A,345.966,355.3145,9.3485,he his vacation is really nice he's going to be there three years at the end of this month and he'll be getting three weeks vacation,2,0
sw3001A-ms98-a,76,A,374.76825,383.330125,8.561875,yeah uh-huh he has it really nice it's nice where he works and um he seems to be very happy you know,1,0
sw3001B-ms98-a,18,B,74.6995,85.421,10.7215,yeah they're hospitals that they're uh agreeing with uh TI that they'll be a certain rate you know for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep co- you know costs down,1,0
sw3001B-ms98-a,20,B,92.763375,104.3195,11.556125,you know kind of thing that uh only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage if you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get,2,0
sw3001B-ms98-a,22,B,112.950125,122.505625,9.5555,if you didn't have the extra dental plus um you only get like a third of your cost which can be kind of expensive with a crown so i i p-,1,0
sw3001B-ms98-a,25,B,131.780375,140.55825,8.777875,um we do have pension although i've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good and i know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that,1,0
sw3001B-ms98-a,30,B,169.499,177.73125,8.23225,that grows pretty good and i think that will be more of something i can see of a pension than the regular pension plan,1,0
sw3002A-ms98-a,29,A,230.482875,239.803875,9.321,well so many of them also come through and they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time whether it be the homeless or uh,1,0
sw3002B-ms98-a,22,B,113.150375,122.196375,9.046,i haven't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis somebody will say oh did you hear about this that happened last week and it might be local and it might be national and i'm,2,0
sw3002B-ms98-a,46,B,205.448875,213.722375,8.2735, and i feel like they sensationalize things that shouldn't be sensationalized i feel like they focus too much on things that,1,0
sw3003A-ms98-a,21,A,107.531625,119.124875,11.59325,it'll be something that we can uh kind of grow into a little bit it's it's tough on trips because uh  anywhere anytime we we're getting ready to go anywhere it's uh,1,0
sw3003A-ms98-a,49,A,266.60825,277.457125,10.848875,it really is and you know and you can't uh you can't afford uh you know a a car payment now it jus- will wipe you out every month it's almost getting wanting to be like a house payment you ,1,0
sw3003A-ms98-a,75,A,401.91075,416.5545,14.64375,on the highway or where it wasn't wasn't as bad you know just for a little brief period of time it would be it would be okay so i'm i'm thinking maybe we can can do something like that later on ye- we'll see what we can do,2,0
sw3003B-ms98-a,3,B,2.7545,10.528125,7.773625,well no it's probably going to be a very old used one my husband had an accident in my car a little over a week ago,1,0
sw3003B-ms98-a,20,B,124.077625,137.708375,13.63075,well not only that needing the room you know we finally ended up buying a Dodge Caravan here about two and a half years ago because_1 i too have very small kids i i have one that's now well she'll be four in September and then a little boy that's just turned two,1,0
sw3003B-ms98-a,31,B,196.67975,209.901625,13.221875,for himself for several years and so he can depreciate cars but you have it used to be you kept them_1 three years well when they did all the tax law changes you had to keep them_1 five so i was trying to keep my BMW in tact in for three more years,1,0
sw3003B-ms98-a,46,B,275.701125,285.857,10.155875,i know you can't find what you used to could find something for you know seventy five a hundred dollars a month it might not be brand new but it was a decent car and you just almost can't find that payment anymore,1,0
sw3003B-ms98-a,65,B,413.4745,415.760125,2.285625,well that would be good,1,0
sw3003B-ms98-a,66,B,415.760125,417.751,1.990875,that would be good,1,0
sw3004A-ms98-a,20,A,78.634,86.6585,8.0245,but maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be you know the individual incidence or something,1,0
sw3004A-ms98-a,38,A,150.7815,156.905375,6.123875,it it's difficult but yet she's the type of person that i don't know if she'd be happy staying at home,1,0
sw3004A-ms98-a,62,A,290.364,296.031875,5.667875,i oft- i always thought that if you were checking into a day care that you would be good to get references,1,0
sw3004A-ms98-a,64,A,302.397875,312.021625,9.62375,because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying you know if there was a problem they they would i think be more ready to tell you what it was,1,0
sw3004A-ms98-a,73,A,336.048875,341.456375,5.4075,but it would be real difficult to pick y- you know to find one and decide,1,0
sw3004A-ms98-a,86,A,374.29025,377.33375,3.0435,since they'll be going back at the end of the month and,1,0
sw3004A-ms98-a,89,A,390.150125,397.40125,7.251125,so uh i'll be able to keep that up a little bit but i thi- i think i'll enjoy,1,0
sw3004B-ms98-a,12,B,26.04375,37.33475,11.291,no i don't i stay home most of the time but i know that it's very difficult to to find good help sometimes when and especially when your when you want your children to be taken care of,1,0
sw3004B-ms98-a,15,B,56.36,70.05225,13.69225,you know there's pros and cons on both side of that because if they were then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing or some kind of something to be o- o- get an okay seal,1,0
sw3004B-ms98-a,24,B,114.676125,121.689625,7.0135,but i've never had to leave them like in a day care center or anything and i've been very lucky just be able to stay home,1,0
sw3004B-ms98-a,75,B,327.140375,335.1785,8.038125,you can't really you can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something and usually they aren't at that age,1,0
sw3004B-ms98-a,80,B,346.89575,360.14725,13.2515,and uh you know i i wondered if i would have to be certified or whether they'd just bring them_1 and and we got to where well we were just friends and so they said no don't do that we'll just bring them_1,1,0
sw3004B-ms98-a,81,B,360.14725,370.509875,10.362625,and then if it was a problem then then we'd sit down and talk about it but it never happened to be a problem and and so things worked out okay and their kids played with my kids and it worked out well,1,0
sw3004B-ms98-a,88,B,389.074125,392.769,3.694875,well that'll be great yeah,1,0
sw3005A-ms98-a,24,A,215.13775,229.921,14.78325,so those are going to get uh uh the squeaky wheel gets the oil they're going to they're going to catch it and somebody has to do it somebody has to do the work like Boeing or General Dynamics or wh- wherever they happen to be you know you've you've you've only got a few plane factories or,1,0
sw3005A-ms98-a,26,A,236.06625,241.882875,5.816625,well i i think they should be outlawed myself the the the packs i don't think they should be,2,0
sw3005B-ms98-a,4,B,18.928,23.53075,4.60275,the- there there seems to be a a,1,0
sw3005B-ms98-a,12,B,80.865625,86.535875,5.67025,districts is geographical but it can just as well be interest groups in terms of of uh,1,0
sw3005B-ms98-a,45,B,228.610125,236.6525,8.042375,well i guess i guess i'm a little more cynical than that i'm not i'm not sure that it that all of it has to be done even but uh,1,0
sw3005B-ms98-a,52,B,264.98,279.347375,14.367375,uh plane that they've developed and they want to se- but developed for the defense depar- -partment and defense department is saying well no we we don't we don't really need it it's going to be too expensive and it's not going to do what we need and,1,0
sw3006A-ms98-a,15,A,87.692375,100.094125,12.40175,and uh  oh you can run a a a regular spaghetti or even a chicken spaghetti type casseroles anything that that can be spread over a large number of people for a few number of dollars,1,0

sw3019B-ms98-a,15,B,54.323375,66.801375,12.478,part of it is that uh i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis and i think that if we're doing other things and these programs come in,1,0
sw3020A-ms98-a,16,A,68.640375,80.393125,11.75275,French people to go and they speak French and so uh you know in that sense is just a little bit easier and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go and,1,0
sw3020A-ms98-a,29,A,142.994875,153.317125,10.32225,the it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide and you there were some places where people defini- there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off,3,0

sw3020B-ms98-a,32,B,132.452875,135.49925,3.046375,that area of the world i think would be great,1,0
sw3021A-ms98-a,16,A,97.6755,111.649375,13.973875,automatic pistol for the FBI which would give them additional firepower it had held like a fifteen shot clip which uh would be able th- they would be able to put down anything that came at them_1,2,0
sw3021A-ms98-a,35,A,198.050375,209.244,11.193625,and no i think that uh you know a a waiting period uh can make a difference but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that,1,0

sw3021B-ms98-a,24,B,111.223875,113.078,1.854125,yeah that would be,1,0
sw3021B-ms98-a,53,B,214.428125,220.240625,5.8125,the the only way they could do it i think would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun,1,0
sw3021B-ms98-a,54,B,220.240625,230.214125,9.9735,you know i think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course i- i feel kind of weird about that anyway i think if somebody shoots somebody they ought to be shot so,1,0
sw3021B-ms98-a,57,B,234.31125,236.969625,2.658375,it would definitely be gun control,1,0
sw3022A-ms98-a,7,A,39.5045,51.119,11.6145,you know uh very hard to find um you know extremely um um yeah impartial people but anyway i think it would be interesting but um,1,0

sw3022A-ms98-a,27,A,161.499375,168.6765,7.177125,and then you watch this guy go to jail for um i should not be telling you because you are going to want to see it,1,0
sw3022A-ms98-a,42,A,248.219,261.913625,13.694625,uh-huh i would love to be on a jury because i i do think it's fascinating i-  i i think it it's it's hard system i mean you are never going to get a right and a wrong you know it's just ,1,0
sw3022A-ms98-a,61,A,321.533,334.275375,12.742375,but  it's just it's scary because um the- there's just so much that can go wrong that could let an innocent person be convicted or a guilty person have them let go ,1,0
sw3022B-ms98-a,17,B,53.90375,61.669,7.76525,well the you know on the suggested topic was to talk about whether uh verdicts had to be unanimous decisions,1,0
sw3022B-ms98-a,19,B,63.56425,69.82,6.25575,that really got me to thinking you know and i think we really need them to be unanimous,1,0
sw3022B-ms98-a,20,B,69.82,70.790625,0.970625,be-,1,0
sw3022B-ms98-a,51,B,174.823625,176.758375,1.93475,that would be awful,1,0
sw3022B-ms98-a,69,B,265.56125,274.82325,9.262,and i think i am like you i think it would be really fascinating i do not think i would want to be on a highly publicized case though i do not think i would like   all ,2,0
sw3022B-ms98-a,84,B,345.120875,350.987125,5.86625,yeah you know it would be split one way or another and and that ends in a mistrial,1,0
sw3023A-ms98-a,5,A,12.027875,17.8745,5.846625,uh before uh simply because the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that,1,0
sw3023A-ms98-a,8,A,30.491375,39.543375,9.052,however i have been persuaded lately i guess simply by the uh overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime,1,0
sw3023A-ms98-a,39,A,210.607,224.802375,14.195375,uh you have to emph- it has to be even uh magnified to attract people's attention i guess to have them spend money on something like that and i am sure that it does form role models for young for young men and young women and,1,0
sw3023A-ms98-a,57,A,311.711625,320.99275,9.281125,uh there's so mu- there's so much of a return from pris- to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure and,1,0
sw3023A-ms98-a,61,A,346.198375,350.07825,3.879875,uh you know it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community,1,0
sw3023A-ms98-a,69,A,386.469875,399.035875,12.566,uh television uh the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that however there does seem to be a right now in verbalizing it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort,3,0
sw3023B-ms98-a,16,B,100.326,111.537125,11.211125,what do you what do you think is is causing all this because it seems that there there even though crime though though i think it is increasing in number it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity and violence too,1,0
sw3023B-ms98-a,24,B,176.36375,184.42625,8.0625,well yeah i tend to agree with you with you know it seems anymore uh a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some,1,0
sw3023B-ms98-a,47,B,295.2855,303.29025,8.00475,that people come down on you it's like you know hey everybody has to be free to do their own thing and i disagree and i think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime,1,0
sw3023B-ms98-a,59,B,401.544875,410.322375,8.7775,how how many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between you know what you see and how you i mean what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do,1,0
sw3023B-ms98-a,64,B,439.169625,443.99675,4.827125,uh some well a lot of it can be contributed to the the,1,0
sw3024A-ms98-a,13,A,56.992,61.082,4.09,we have uh it would be like a,1,0
sw3024A-ms98-a,14,A,61.082,72.676,11.594,i do not know i guess it would be like a family room other than from the playroom the playroom is where we watch all our TV and stuff but we have another room you know kind of like for company and stuff,1,0
sw3024A-ms98-a,69,A,331.622125,344.790875,13.16875,uh-huh well we have a wood burner in our house and you know it heats a lot of it because it is a larger house  would be too much to heat with just electric but uh we have  yeah,1,0
sw3024B-ms98-a,60,B,255.79225,269.25975,13.4675,okay because we were looking at something that people are we have seen advertised called i guess it's {berber} or something or {berbar} or something and uh and we understand that that's supposed to be good for like a family room cause it's you know it wears really well and all that,1,0
sw3025A-ms98-a,95,A,352.295375,362.18375,9.888375,that's why i think that's one reason i like having people over because i could try things i mean i must be a frustrated chemist or something like that because_1 cooking is a little bit like like being in a chemistry lab,1,0
sw3025A-ms98-a,109,A,401.93925,409.1445,7.20525,thought that was su- he was supposed to be there at six o'clock not seven o'clock so just at the time all this happened the door bell rang and there he was,1,0
sw3025B-ms98-a,51,B,236.19075,238.892125,2.701375,it's uh supposed to be a candy,1,0
sw3026A-ms98-a,30,A,117.747625,120.389875,2.64225,um that'd be fun,1,0
sw3026A-ms98-a,39,A,162.4575,172.878875,10.421375,well uh i wherever she wherever she was she was out you know on the edge but anyway she uh had some great pictures and i always thought that would be fun to go there and they have great beaches too,1,0
sw3026A-ms98-a,42,A,179.318875,187.006125,7.68725,hey that would be fun yeah when i was little i always heard how romantic Rio was but i would like to go to Tahiti too that'd be fun,2,0
sw3026B-ms98-a,16,B,105.13725,110.003,4.86575,i'd like to you even if we just get away for three or four days i think it would be kind of neat,1,0
sw3026B-ms98-a,18,B,115.5865,119.108875,3.522375,but uh i don't think that's going to be possible now,1,0
sw3026B-ms98-a,43,B,278.9,282.1435,3.2435,and it doesn't appear we're going to be opening any new offices,1,0
sw3026B-ms98-a,45,B,286.3525,287.91325,1.56075,that'd be all right,1,0
sw3027A-ms98-a,46,A,404.998625,418.258375,13.25975,an enormous amount of money to put that up yeah put something up like a space station that would work and really really be beneficial for us and uh i don't i don't know it's if it's worth it ,1,0
sw3027B-ms98-a,1,B,0,11.95375,11.95375,the space program seems to have run into a little bit of a snag funding wise anyway they've decided the space station's not may not be worth it and uh they're going to fight over that for a few years it seems,1,0
sw3027B-ms98-a,3,B,19.829125,27.053,7.223875,the complexity and the seeming uh number of errors and breakdowns and problems they're having with it uh it may not be,1,0
sw3027B-ms98-a,7,B,52.096625,62.49075,10.394125,we can do all we want as far as technology goes but if a human can't stand to be up there then what good does is it to have the station that for extended stays if you can't stand an extended stay,1,0
sw3027B-ms98-a,9,B,68.663375,79.219,10.555625,really should be spent with the idea of uh or with the goal of of the space station or of claiming a sector of space or having defense out in space,1,0
sw3027B-ms98-a,11,B,92.43825,103.58025,11.142,tends to be uh based on a lot of a lot of that lately of course it really wreaks havoc with the economy when the government decides to shut down things like bases and and uh,1,0
sw3027B-ms98-a,25,B,280.85875,294.36275,13.504,so that when something catas- some catastrophe does occur and it does have to be curtailed y- you don't gut the economy sort of like the defense industry problem has has occurred uh as as needs changed in the defense world then,1,0
sw3027B-ms98-a,27,B,302.695,314.16725,11.47225,you do that with the space program and now as complex and as many different directions as they're being tugged with technology uh they want to be so big that if we ever did allow that um,1,0
sw3027B-ms98-a,28,B,314.16725,319.687125,5.519875,uh we're liable to be in the same boat and once these contracts are finished or if the space,1,0
sw3027B-ms98-a,29,B,319.687125,332.01075,12.323625, platform disintegrated for whatever reason uh maybe there'd be that many thousands of jobs that were supplying  you know parts to that that weren't there anymore you'd have to go back to the jobs that needed to,1,0
sw3027B-ms98-a,30,B,332.01075,342.04825,10.0375,be there when that was being created instead of being sustained and you know y- you can't have uh a quarter of the economy resting on one little project up there,1,0
sw3027B-ms98-a,38,B,416.787375,431.131875,14.3445,well they keep talking about uh the space station the biggest thing they want to do up there is is test out different manufacturing techniques uh in weightlessness but are these i- i never could quite figure out whether these techniques were something that could be done,1,0
sw3028A-ms98-a,111,A,366.0995,369.9695,3.87,so i mean we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy,1,0
sw3028B-ms98-a,25,B,100.987125,104.01125,3.024125,uh i think so it should be,1,0
sw3028B-ms98-a,30,B,116.000125,120.592,4.591875,to be able to find it i think it's uh probably listed in the restaurants you know,1,0
sw3028B-ms98-a,54,B,227.596875,233.285125,5.68825,it would be good i think uh i don't know how expensive they are it sounds like that it would probably,1,0
sw3028B-ms98-a,60,B,251.448125,264.53575,13.087625,see i i won't really be interested in going to going there because i feel like i'm i'm paying you know five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that i could get along quite well ,1,0
sw3028B-ms98-a,97,B,438.670625,445.636,6.965375,so i'm either going to be i'm either going to starve to death or i'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can you know,1,0
sw3029A-ms98-a,3,A,6.26625,19.15025,12.884, well it seems to be in the current situations but uh i still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now,2,0
sw3029A-ms98-a,9,A,42.76825,53.290125,10.521875,uh i feel uh there should be more than a slap on the hand and being sent to prison and being released in uh two or three years,1,0
sw3029A-ms98-a,46,A,235.02625,242.939625,7.913375,but these individuals if they have a gun with them i think that the the sentence should be even longer than if they don't,1,0
sw3029A-ms98-a,50,A,247.7275,261.690125,13.962625,well but here again uh if a matter of expediency part of these costs like the people on Death Row is that their appeals can take years and years there should be some uh i know there's a law i believe that,1,0
sw3029A-ms98-a,54,A,272.587875,275.583125,2.99525,and a decision be made and not drag out,1,0
sw3029A-ms98-a,56,A,276.92675,282.972375,6.045625,for years because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities there might be,1,0
sw3029A-ms98-a,58,A,285.465125,288.81875,3.353625,right th- there's got to be a there's got to be a time limit,2,0
sw3029B-ms98-a,5,B,27.883375,40.208625,12.32525,need to be reevaluated i think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not    bad at all crimes against children is one of them,1,0
sw3029B-ms98-a,24,B,102.608625,108.344375,5.73575,deciding what that proper punishment is is one thing i think that there should be no way,1,0
sw3029B-ms98-a,26,B,115.2455,122.1675,6.922,innocent people could do that but for every innocent person who would be executed hopefully there would be ten guilty,2,0
sw3029B-ms98-a,40,B,152.263875,164.50325,12.239375,well i don't have solutions to the problems but you know you have these this would be nice if and there's probably thousands of holes in that theory but i think that if you,1,0
sw3029B-ms98-a,71,B,280.87875,286.075,5.19625,that's right technical i think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals,1,0
sw3029B-ms98-a,73,B,288.585875,301.571,12.985125,i think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is if if it is contradictory,1,0
sw3029B-ms98-a,98,B,412.660375,423.674,11.013625,that's right and and it i don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter,1,0
sw3030A-ms98-a,40,A,194.252125,199.9465,5.694375,um but that's that's basically what we do is the gourmet so you know they would be pretty elaborate,1,0
sw3030A-ms98-a,44,A,224.91525,237.265375,12.350125,and um and whatever you can do you know to do that i don't think you have to be you know more than hamburgers and hot dogs out in the backyard and the and the coleslaw and potato salad but but,1,0
sw3030B-ms98-a,29,B,147.266875,157.20125,9.934375,when when we entertain i usually try to find something that would be  um kind of good for everybody and that that sometimes means you can't do gourmet ,1,0
sw3030B-ms98-a,55,B,246.72925,256.846125,10.116875,buying cold cuts  well i have to make a cake and i have to make hors d'oeuvres and i have to make dessert so i figured for the main thing it's going to be sandwiches,1,0
sw3030B-ms98-a,62,B,277.0035,280.128125,3.124625,wouldn't that be nice ,1,0
sw3031B-ms98-a,107,B,339.3075,345.2355,5.928,so he said let's bring that down so he's putting me on some liquid protein and i'm not doing to be able to eat for two weeks,1,0
sw3031B-ms98-a,111,B,354.663625,361.75725,7.093625,um so i think it's supposed to be one eighty and he thought two forty was a little bit high for me,1,0
sw3032A-ms98-a,29,A,191.79275,198.904625,7.111875,that's  probably there should be uh uh a mandatory limit on on how long you can serve like maybe only two terms ,1,0
sw3032B-ms98-a,48,B,187.56525,191.686875,4.121625,but you'd what what it would end up it would be the same old people going so,1,0
sw3032B-ms98-a,68,B,272.153,276.22925,4.07625,that's all right my wife's a psychologist and i thought that might be somebody calling in for her,1,0
sw3032B-ms98-a,82,B,336.5115,343.42325,6.91175,she's trying to cutback but she has to be so careful and that's the problem is that you if you come in too fast,1,0
sw3032B-ms98-a,101,B,400.197,409.852625,9.655625,no we don't we don't  the um we and you mentioned the pri- prison population another thing you can do in the budget we've got a lot of people who don't need to be in prison,1,0
sw3032B-ms98-a,105,B,431.12525,438.318125,7.192875,a decent wage you you'd whatever you'd pay them_1 would be a lot better than having them_1 in jail or having them_1 out on the street,1,0
sw3033A-ms98-a,2,A,0.55775,12.75525,12.1975,okay well good morning and uh i guess the topic here is going to be h- hobbies and if you have any just tell me what they are,1,0
sw3033A-ms98-a,8,A,38.076,48.465625,10.389625,i don't know if there'll be a second one but    is you know hand pieced and hand sewn and it took months upon months to do this anyway um,1,0
sw3033A-ms98-a,23,A,156.841125,162.83025,5.989125,you're right yeah they love that that would be good really and uh,1,0
sw3033A-ms98-a,27,A,180.75025,188.27125,7.521,the vests and things like that and they make whole outfits out of you know scraps of this and that and it's getting to be a real art form,1,0
sw3033A-ms98-a,29,A,199.774625,206.27275,6.498125,and and be able to be trained and and do some things like that so that's a lot of fun i,2,0
sw3033B-ms98-a,17,B,105.384,109.40425,4.02025,well to me the quilting sounds like the thing that would be,1,0
sw3033B-ms98-a,25,B,146.100125,158.7745,12.674375,and i thought it'd be nice if i could find you know maybe uh in senior citizens home or something to give the pieces to maybe these people could use a litt- bits of uh you know leftover fabric,1,0
sw3033B-ms98-a,36,B,216.665875,223.364125,6.69825,but i think it'd be nice to learn how to arrange silk flowers and uh save yourself some money on some of the flower arrangements,1,0
sw3033B-ms98-a,60,B,346.37875,356.401,10.02225,and uh i thought i'll i'll either be working on this constantly or i'm never going to have these finished by Christmas but they really did turn out pretty i was really pleased with them,1,0
sw3034A-ms98-a,32,A,143.654875,147.78275,4.127875,uh it seems to be too physical for my uh interest,1,0
sw3034A-ms98-a,42,A,197.55125,202.918625,5.367375,i'm always af- because the injuries are s- uh can be very very devastating,1,0
sw3034A-ms98-a,81,A,429.464125,438.972875,9.50875,tried to uh win a lot of money for the junior achievement uh organization but that's the only thing that i would you know be allowed to do,1,0
sw3034B-ms98-a,51,B,221.429125,225.517375,4.08825,baseball that's true i i would say that baseball tends to be one of the less,1,0
sw3034B-ms98-a,69,B,314.644125,323.922875,9.27875,i it was just flag football too i separated it again and it seemed to be like the straw that broke the camels back so,1,0
sw3034B-ms98-a,87,B,438.93375,447.788625,8.854875,well my grandmother has been bowling for gosh maybe thirty forty years i don't know a long time and she still she's got to be,1,0
sw3035A-ms98-a,23,A,148.75375,158.902625,10.148875,it's really a sad commentary on uh you know on life in general that uh you know that children can't cannot be allowed to grow up uh you know without ,1,0
sw3035A-ms98-a,34,A,227.336375,236.66225,9.325875,the uh there i- there does seem to be a lot more  in the curriculum it's a lot more complicated a lot more available of course,1,0
sw3035A-ms98-a,35,A,236.66225,249.628875,12.966625,but uh there s- seem to be a so much more to learn now that it it really makes it more difficult i would think i w- i would probably have a hard time getting through school myself uh you know i just or at least it'd be a lot harder than it was when i went to school,2,0
sw3035A-ms98-a,59,A,374.043,380.137625,6.094625,a- an- an- and that's kind of contradictory to what i said but you know y- th- ha- you have to be under control,1,0
sw3035A-ms98-a,63,A,396.747125,409.720625,12.9735,to encourage students to not be as  you know to not concentrate as much on education you know they're they're there for a good time and you know to to see how little they can get by with ,1,0
sw3035B-ms98-a,33,B,197.855625,205.281625,7.426,and it and it seems like it's a lot more they n- they need to know and be able to do than when we are the- when i had to go into ki- kindergarten,1,0
sw3035B-ms98-a,34,B,205.281625,218.53,13.248375,and it seems like it's more uh you know i don't know they're  expecting more or uh or just uh you know kids just because_1 of the computer age or whatever it just know more but when they get to you know to be five or six or something,1,0
sw3035B-ms98-a,43,B,264.078625,272.415125,8.3365,and i think it's important because i think that uh you know it gives him the interaction with the computer because_1 it sure looks like that's gonna be your you know the big thing for a long time,1,0
sw3035B-ms98-a,74,B,415.83625,428.340625,12.504375,and uh it seems like it's a lot of the problem is to you know you always have the lack of funds but it seems to be getting worse and worse and so they don't have the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as as as kids need ,1,0
sw3036A-ms98-a,2,A,0.53475,7.273125,6.738375,well uh if you had to pick a a type of music that you like would you be able to,1,0
sw3036A-ms98-a,20,A,85.24675,100.23175,14.985,i mean because it's just it will always be there it's classic and i don't have to worry about you know what's current and what's not because i haven't been current with music for a long time but you know same ,1,0
sw3036A-ms98-a,37,A,176.107625,177.7505,1.642875,that would be good,1,0
sw3036A-ms98-a,61,A,284.311875,295.528,11.216125,and uh then it'll if it survives then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of hey listen what we listened  can you believe this sort of thing but ,1,0
sw3037A-ms98-a,72,A,312.9625,319.485625,6.523125,well i- i would be um i don't have any desire to but i would be awfully fearful because of all the uh,2,0
sw3037B-ms98-a,44,B,288.891,291.96475,3.07375,and and and in in you know in some cases it would be,1,0
sw3037B-ms98-a,45,B,291.96475,303.768375,11.803625,uh a group of friends that you know that i would know about that you know i'm not a drug user i have not ever been and will not ever be but i you know i've known people that have talked about it you know and uh,1,0
sw3037B-ms98-a,59,B,361.022375,374.11625,13.093875,i think they're asking for for the Constitution to be interpreted to say hey you can't do this it's you know it's a viol- from my point of view it's a violation of you know of of  a person ,1,0
sw3038A-ms98-a,58,A,401.821125,409.041125,7.22,on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was,1,0
sw3039A-ms98-a,25,A,105.061375,116.682625,11.62125,for help  we don't we don't have that luxury but we have lots of friends and and everybody tends to be in the same boat so we t- we trade off a whole lot with friends and you know,1,0
sw3039A-ms98-a,54,A,237.002625,246.25275,9.250125,it can be and and sometimes i uh you know i kind of long for the good old days when  we didn't do all these running but on the other hand,1,0
sw3039B-ms98-a,46,B,164.43925,170.16,5.72075,so now it's just you know that she's kind of resolved herself that yes this is going to be the only one,1,0
sw3039B-ms98-a,62,B,230.552875,238.128125,7.57525,yeah you're now i think every- everything is doing doing doing out of the house which can be very hectic,1,0
sw3039B-ms98-a,75,B,281.686625,292.09375,10.407125,uh those type of children um that are involved in things like that their uh goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things,1,0
sw3039B-ms98-a,85,B,315.643125,323.152375,7.50925,that's wonderful that's really is nice to have in your background that you know then you can you're you can be very flexible,1,0
sw3040A-ms98-a,33,A,184.058625,188.46725,4.408625,yeah well that that that would be true that would be true but,2,0
sw3040B-ms98-a,16,B,122.877,134.376625,11.499625,then again the the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent and the p- public colleges also the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country,1,0
sw3040B-ms98-a,18,B,140.969625,153.505375,12.53575,the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition well if you double the tuition it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states,1,0
sw3040B-ms98-a,27,B,191.72575,203.9405,12.21475,but all the various t- taxing authorities that come through i think the one tax i resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime,1,0
sw3040B-ms98-a,29,B,215.52325,226.42025,10.897,well this this is a thing i think it's like uh back east you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities you can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it,1,0
sw3041B-ms98-a,11,B,50.015125,59.994875,9.97975,that's kind of a twist on the normal thing And it made me think a lot about you know you would applaud Bruce Willis in Die Hard if he was doing this but you might not be so,1,0
sw3041B-ms98-a,50,B,209.028625,210.99475,1.966125,they made them to be,1,0
sw3041B-ms98-a,74,B,328.256125,334.615625,6.3595,so we decided that may be the mark of a good film it made us think and so we were grouchy we felt guilty,1,0
sw3042B-ms98-a,76,B,379.73975,386.491375,6.751625,as hot and muggy as it would be being over hundred plus ninety degree humidity ninety percent humidity,1,0
sw3043A-ms98-a,26,A,78.32375,88.185625,9.861875,the thing that my husband and i do could very easily be incorporated with children because_1 we like to go camping and we like to we have a boat so we go in the boat all the time and so,1,0
sw3043A-ms98-a,42,A,136.225625,138.00825,1.782625,well that will be fun,1,0
sw3043A-ms98-a,118,A,377.427,388.2345,10.8075,yeah well we have all i mean and i both have camped since we were little with our parents and so i think it's very natural and i'm sure that's the way it will be and oh we've already looked in the ,1,0
sw3043B-ms98-a,2,B,1.29975,12.24275,10.943,all right well i'll just start by saying that we we spend our time you know having a formal dinner on on the weekend and that's when we try and get together it might be breakfast it might be and we try and talk about,2,0
sw3043B-ms98-a,5,B,20.5025,25.04925,4.54675,they are at home um our oldest daughter is going to be a senior at SMU,1,0
sw3043B-ms98-a,46,B,218.513875,223.750875,5.237,and and i know everybody around you your family will be very supportive and very anxious too i'm sure,1,0
sw3043B-ms98-a,98,B,424.04475,431.828125,7.783375,yeah yeah well that's interesting i am not timing this conversation because i guess you're supposed to be in control it says ,1,0
sw3043B-ms98-a,101,B,434.355875,440.65875,6.302875,well this is my first call so um yeah yeah i- i enjoy uh this is really going to be a neat thing i think,1,0
sw3045A-ms98-a,50,A,194.03875,201.468625,7.429875,also um i w- do some work at UTD and um that's what they have there and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and,1,0
sw3045A-ms98-a,51,A,201.468625,215.3935,13.924875,and already know the lan- you know already know the the software and um i don't know from my own experience um WordPerfect just just so much better than than WordStar at least the version of WordStar that i used to have it may be improved by now but,1,0
sw3045A-ms98-a,52,A,215.3935,228.441375,13.047875,yeah it's uh WordStar was never very intuitive to me i mean you know you some of the commands just had nothing to do with w- you know what you were supposed to be doing what they what they did on the com- computer but uh i mean like going um,1,0
sw3045A-ms98-a,59,A,267.060875,278.709,11.648125,yeah yeah and i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper      and retype everything and uh it was just awful so um i don't know i think we have just become,1,0
sw3045A-ms98-a,60,A,278.709,291.598875,12.889875,really spoiled but i think it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled  so um well i have not really paid much attention to a clock although i think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes so um,1,0
sw3045A-ms98-a,79,A,402.7415,410.964625,8.223125,um i think that that would be a real a real uh advantage to to her to have that and uh do it early so uh do y- do,1,0
sw3045A-ms98-a,90,A,439.825375,449.585875,9.7605,well Nola i have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly this is really going to be fun i think and um my husband is a ham radio operator and i think about all the people that he talks to all over the,1,0
sw3045B-ms98-a,17,B,110.227875,119.494875,9.267, but um they're kind of old older so i'm not sure that we'll be able to do get too many other programs for it ,1,0
sw3045B-ms98-a,64,B,421.3575,434.089125,12.731625,and so i decided well if she's going to do that it would be a whole lot easier if she could type  so we'll slowly learn to to type here and then then put the story in,1,0
sw3046A-ms98-a,58,A,174.641,183.071375,8.430375,bread family and your or least what it used to be the regular menu followed and ham and bake potatoes and uh,1,0
sw3046A-ms98-a,66,A,224.623625,236.83,12.206375,uh-huh uh-huh well my husband didn't like that so we as kids we had five children and we ate that when he he wasn't going to be home for supper that's what we had ,1,0
sw3046B-ms98-a,17,B,44.930875,52.012375,7.0815,yeah i guess so it may be interesting because probably here in Texas we may eat a little differently than you do up there ,1,0
sw3046B-ms98-a,72,B,261.280375,268.565,7.284625,well yeah it could be bec- they don't i think it's the texture of it but it takes more chewing  and,1,0
sw3047A-ms98-a,12,A,53.4575,58.57725,5.11975,what's going to be best for them in terms of what what their career goals are,1,0
sw3048A-ms98-a,24,A,146.288625,149.2655,2.976875,yeah and i never thought about that the news coverage might be,1,0
sw3048A-ms98-a,26,A,150.725375,152.8585,2.133125,it you would be better off not knowing i guess,1,0
sw3048A-ms98-a,79,A,336.913875,339.489375,2.5755,dealing with them again it won't be long,1,0
sw3048B-ms98-a,57,B,312.617625,320.411625,7.794,see i don't think that is right i think the United States should but they put down and go over there and be and just go over there and go through it period you know ,1,0
sw3048B-ms98-a,63,B,339.370625,342.267,2.896375,well he'll be back,1,0
sw3049A-ms98-a,41,A,176.55375,191.13425,14.5805,and that's the way i do it and i go quite frequently if you are going to be planning on doing that now i saw Warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a of a witch hunt that is you know magically shot into the present time ,2,0
sw3049A-ms98-a,53,A,274.722375,283.817375,9.095,and then oh let's see there's a couple or three that i would like to go see before they go into videos i guess i can wait another month and they will be videos,1,0
sw3049A-ms98-a,54,A,283.817375,289.809625,5.99225,one is Silence of the Lambs i've heard a lot about that one they say if you really want to be,1,0
sw3049A-ms98-a,81,A,396.4965,410.513,14.0165,i yeah i didn't care for the type of movie but he was always slick and greasy and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed and  didn't like him but he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older i thought,1,0
sw3049B-ms98-a,92,B,442.570125,447.31775,4.747625,oh okay trying to be a cop or something yeah,1,0
sw3050B-ms98-a,10,B,39.992625,46.60775,6.615125,no actually i don't even know if i checked that or not to be perfectly honest um  it seems to have been a mistake i don't know um,1,0
sw3050B-ms98-a,35,B,162.9855,166.2105,3.225,oh wow so so you must be very busy,1,0
sw3050B-ms98-a,61,B,299.721875,304.68325,4.961375,it seems to be it seems that a lot of people are really you know either um either you haven't played it,1,0
sw3050B-ms98-a,95,B,440.998,449.694875,8.696875,and we both just sort of get these random checks in the mail and to be honest i- i really have not been accounting i just sort of figured well it's going to work you know if it works it works so,1,0
sw3051A-ms98-a,62,A,281.531375,296.076,14.544625,well see that's the house that we got is small enough so my husband and i because_1 there's just the two of us and the two cats um can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard and we thought that was important instead of  swallowed up in something that you know,1,0
sw3051A-ms98-a,83,A,387.280375,390.984125,3.70375,must be a dream come true yeah,1,0
sw3051B-ms98-a,37,B,210.777875,221.399,10.621125,no it could not be because this house is around thirty four hundred square feet and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars just never,1,0
sw3051B-ms98-a,40,B,228.551375,242.8885,14.337125,or and that's pretty much what it was built for it's got an awful lot of nice things in it but you know i don't think i think it's going to be a long time if ever when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities,1,0
sw3051B-ms98-a,50,B,295.26125,302.575,7.31375,see when you have kids you like to be able to send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them but i have been watching these houses go up and i- i,1,0
sw3052A-ms98-a,16,A,66.044375,77.195625,11.15125,uh my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home un-,1,0
sw3052A-ms98-a,17,A,77.195625,84.206875,7.01125,unless unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home,1,0
sw3052A-ms98-a,42,A,231.333,241.93625,10.60325,and uh they said the the woman the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or,1,0
sw3052A-ms98-a,57,A,312.374125,315.6355,3.261375,i- i would hate to be in a position where,1,0
sw3052B-ms98-a,10,B,83.41,92.779375,9.369375,well even at that point most care can be given at in the home that sound like just an excellent solution you must feel real good about that,1,0
sw3052B-ms98-a,29,B,243.75875,248.295125,4.536375,what a shame they put him in the home so that he could be cared for,1,0
sw3052B-ms98-a,47,B,321.555875,331.7285,10.172625, my ex-husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for oh it must be seven eight years and um,1,0
sw3052B-ms98-a,60,B,391.72575,399.85375,8.128,i- i really i think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care,1,0
sw3053A-ms98-a,64,A,219.11025,231.441,12.33075,i we had this last year of school i had my last paper of college and i am  this paper on Bette Midler i was decided i was not going to be very academic finally and uh,1,0
sw3053B-ms98-a,85,B,311.459875,314.2,2.740125, oh that would be awful,1,0
sw3054A-ms98-a,24,A,132.801,142.6365,9.8355,so you didn't have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk walk around and uh gave us some s- you know some place to stack things during the day so that was real nice ,1,0
sw3054A-ms98-a,28,A,166.337625,174.211375,7.87375,uh everything was very convenient and you didn't have to to be hauling things out of your the trunk of you car so that was nice yeah,1,0
sw3054A-ms98-a,52,A,256.69375,262.17275,5.479,well that might be some place where we my husband and i can go we're talking about starting camping again in the fall,1,0
sw3054A-ms98-a,53,A,262.17275,273.750875,11.578125,um our children are both grown and and so it's just pretty much the two of us who do things and so uh we thought we might take some weekend trips then and maybe that would be a good place to to to go to and see what it looks like ,1,0
sw3055A-ms98-a,32,A,195.321875,207.325875,12.004,yeah uh-huh it's just very customary to get flan so if you ever run into that  you'll sort of be aware of what that's all about but uh i would never have thought of making that as part of a a Mexican dinner but,1,0
sw3055A-ms98-a,33,A,207.325875,220.840625,13.51475,you know so papillas i guess would be another kind of a dessert if you decided to do something like that but  flan is something you can make ahead and have just uh you know have ready but uh oh i would have been thinking i would like to have a dinner party sometime soon but,1,0
sw3055A-ms98-a,78,A,404.4545,418.4975,14.043,well talk about working with big amounts of pie crust and having it be tough  those were the toughest apple crust or apple uh pie crust that i have ever ever made it was just terrible i- i could have used that recipe it sounds like  ,1,0
sw3055A-ms98-a,83,A,448.136375,449.680125,1.54375,i'll be darn and,1,0
sw3055B-ms98-a,24,B,122.39675,134.6945,12.29775,dessert and you know it's got to be gone or daddy gets into the you know the leftovers and puts about two more inches on his waistline and then he is  chastising himself afterwards  ,1,0
sw3055B-ms98-a,62,B,321.252,328.3005,7.0485,um n- i no i think it would be too hazy because um the uh no i ,1,0
sw3055B-ms98-a,69,B,378.2695,388.97375,10.70425,twenty years ago and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it and it will still be flaky and i thought wow that's quite a statement for them to make,1,0
sw3056A-ms98-a,15,A,127.103,132.7165,5.6135,that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that,1,0
sw3056A-ms98-a,31,A,251.900375,257.252375,5.352,i- i think that would be i am sure there is something out there uh that might be a,2,0

sw3057A-ms98-a,34,A,66.17375,70.696625,4.522875,it seems like they must be waiting until it's a necessity,1,0
sw3057A-ms98-a,115,A,288.934,294.8635,5.9295,th- this is the age and  there has to be consideration taken on everything so,1,0
sw3057A-ms98-a,146,A,414.63275,421.76325,7.1305,people resist uh the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing you know,1,0
sw3057A-ms98-a,147,A,421.76325,423.7705,2.00725,it seems to be a resistance,1,0
sw3057A-ms98-a,153,A,429.706625,433.139375,3.43275,right right but there seems to be a resistance,1,0
sw3057B-ms98-a,30,B,154.883375,169.184875,14.3015,oh i am certainly very much for a nursing home and i think when the the parent gets old enough to the extent where they just don't want to be bothered with keeping house and with taking care of themselves anymore that is a wonderful alternative it's expensive ,1,0
sw3057B-ms98-a,38,B,202.494375,212.1305,9.636125,i know that the elderly can easily be abused but i would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than are they are in  homes of their own children ,2,0
sw3057B-ms98-a,47,B,226.23,235.862375,9.632375,well now my grandmother of course all of my folks lived to be very old and my grandmother developed Hodgkin's Disease when she was in her late eighties uh late seventies i mean,1,0

sw3057B-ms98-a,67,B,318.850875,326.88675,8.035875,absolutely i think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they're going to be needing those facilities one day,1,0
sw3058B-ms98-a,100,B,436.1555,441.496625,5.341125, so you know whether or not it will be as good as you know Jaws was i don't i don't know,1,0
sw3059A-ms98-a,49,A,277.462375,281.842,4.379625,uh i didn't really find it to be a tearjerker ,1,0

sw3059B-ms98-a,74,B,228.50475,238.93825,10.4335,i i guess i i hate to be too surprised in a movie and in that one you could you could pretty well guess where it was going to end up you weren't sure exactly,1,0
sw3060A-ms98-a,42,A,154.63025,162.706875,8.076625,yeah definitely yeah i used to go see them they weren't nobodies then but i did go see them before they got to be major big stars,1,0

sw3060A-ms98-a,103,A,397.147125,407.10925,9.962125,well i hope it's really funny though because i'll be at the club working out and i'll hear the aerobics music going and i'll think God that's a remake of an old song ,1,0
sw3060B-ms98-a,29,B,99.61,106.755,7.145,well who are you going to go see now i mean who do you see now that's going to be somebody someday ,1,0
sw3060B-ms98-a,97,B,387.0205,398.166625,11.146125,and she's really up on all the new music even better than i am and and i mean she just likes music and she's just a person that's really with it so maybe you'll be like she is,1,0
sw3061A-ms98-a,13,A,20.367375,32.07825,11.710875, kind of lose track  well that's interesting because we have a similar we don't have cats but we do have a dog who is an indoor dog and she is going to be thirteen this summer so yes uh-huh,1,0
sw3061A-ms98-a,39,A,161.69,171.38525,9.69525,our son on the other hand who was about eleven at the time was um not very interested in pets but as it turned out he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals,1,0
sw3061A-ms98-a,58,A,241.56775,255.753625,14.185875,but um our guide that day said that the la- one woman uh many many years ago had given a huge sum of money to to the university on the condition that there be um dogs just kind of left to roam ar- around the campus,1,0
sw3061A-ms98-a,78,A,336.534625,339.190375,2.65575,i'll be darned how interesting,1,0
sw3061A-ms98-a,105,A,406.350125,407.53775,1.187625,i'll be,1,0
sw3061B-ms98-a,8,B,18.475375,24.478875,6.0035,they might be as old i'm not sure  yeah,1,0
sw3061B-ms98-a,18,B,43.99375,46.842625,2.848875,oh uh-huh i'll be darned,1,0
sw3061B-ms98-a,26,B,61.829125,64.57825,2.749125,well that's to be expected at their age,1,0
sw3061B-ms98-a,103,B,343.1085,348.205,5.0965,th- they be- before we got her everybody said oh they're just like a cat you know,1,0
sw3062A-ms98-a,33,A,132.880875,137.408375,4.5275,good good that's great for parents to be involved,1,0
sw3062A-ms98-a,66,A,304.923,307.975875,3.052875,that's right they can be selective right,1,0
sw3062B-ms98-a,17,B,98.427125,103.583125,5.156,you know it's amazing he will be able to y- you'll say to him spell cat ,1,0
sw3062B-ms98-a,24,B,151.683625,162.668,10.984375,she had picked it up yep she had already picked it up and she said you know we we were going to call you if you hadn't called us we think there's a learning disability and we think he needs to be tested immediately,1,0
sw3062B-ms98-a,54,B,287.096875,296.684375,9.5875,you know you can't say um you know i know Steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability and into a private school,1,0
sw3062B-ms98-a,57,B,307.180875,313.9895,6.808625,and they ca- they that's right they have the ability to be selective but you can't say then well public schools are,1,0
sw3062B-ms98-a,75,B,394.1815,406.30325,12.12175,you know these children they they had to be the best and they put off all social life all everything you know well is that good yes the child is very bright,1,0
sw3062B-ms98-a,77,B,411.026625,421.803875,10.77725,have are more rounded you know sure sure i think it's real important to have friends i think it's real important to play sports i think it's real important to be part of a team,1,0
sw3063A-ms98-a,9,A,52.8135,64.3485,11.535,but that's not and i think it can be resolved if uh if they really let go with the technology that they have at uh at their hand and they haven't released it yet,1,0
sw3063A-ms98-a,55,A,256.158125,268.6345,12.476375,the the learning of it and the just to um think that way we have to be in that thought pattern and able to um motivate ourselves to um,1,0
sw3063A-ms98-a,63,A,308.632125,314.8185,6.186375,well hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past,1,0
sw3063A-ms98-a,72,A,365.434625,369.5175,4.082875,what grade level would that be would that be um,2,0
sw3063A-ms98-a,73,A,369.5175,372.6635,3.146,perhaps the first grade level which would be,1,0
sw3063B-ms98-a,57,B,223.222,228.1715,4.9495,um-hum well it's going to it's probably going to be a generation or two before,1,0
sw3063B-ms98-a,60,B,240.114375,246.6455,6.531125,it'll be you know on down the road this is going to be passed on which is good,2,0
sw3064A-ms98-a,55,A,265.534625,273.157875,7.62325,meantime though i'm not building any reserves anything that i could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards,1,0
sw3064B-ms98-a,44,B,217.618125,229.090625,11.4725,i think about young people that think you know there's kind of that feeling of hey it's so neat i have my first credit card and and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments you know,1,0
sw3065A-ms98-a,10,A,39.978125,50.395625,10.4175,i mean businesses and things to use it so you know what  what i think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while and then and then start phasing things out so,1,0
sw3065A-ms98-a,17,A,85.39,89.31175,3.92175,yeah i would i would be total loss i think,1,0
sw3065A-ms98-a,18,A,89.31175,98.64125,9.3295,i think though if there was some you know sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over you know and i think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed and ,1,0
sw3065A-ms98-a,25,A,130.971,140.611875,9.640875,right well what i think i think the difference between now and then might be this is just a might is we were the first generation that was  in elementary school,1,0
sw3065A-ms98-a,30,A,167.737375,180.811625,13.07425,eventually they'll be able to make the switch and we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying what are you crazy we can't understand you we'll say oh it's a pain in the neck but it's for the better and we'll sort of deal with it i think,1,0
sw3065A-ms98-a,31,A,180.811625,188.46,7.648375,i don't know i- i- i would hope it would uh it seems like it's a reasonable system i mean everything seems to be based on the same thing,1,0
sw3065A-ms98-a,45,A,238.406125,248.4325,10.026375,you can't walk in here you have to be under well i guess what what i bet what they do in that case they uh see what some of them is like you know they say if you're not taller than this line,1,0
sw3065A-ms98-a,50,A,255.231,260.5695,5.3385,it would be a neat case where like where kids taught the parents i think you know,1,0
sw3065A-ms98-a,57,A,279.21475,284.633125,5.418375,like like like sort of stupid i mean we are of course we are Americans and we're supposed to be you know,1,0
sw3065A-ms98-a,67,A,317.425625,322.16525,4.739625,i can right   what you go to wouldn't be a problem,1,0
sw3065B-ms98-a,4,B,15.8495,20.453625,4.604125,it's it's a switch the problem would just be the switch over ,1,0
sw3065B-ms98-a,6,B,24.430375,32.166875,7.7365,right that's when i was in the elementary school years and we all we all learned that metric and they were ready we were going to be metric and,1,0
sw3065B-ms98-a,27,B,120.511125,129.150125,8.639,it would be difficult but it would not be as difficult for people say fifty years old now who are have never been exposed to the metric system other than,2,0
sw3065B-ms98-a,41,B,194.02575,202.879125,8.853375,when you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore uh you'd be  a hundred and seventy centimeters and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in,3,0
sw3065B-ms98-a,42,B,202.879125,210.577375,7.69825,in pounds so all the dieters would be happy  i only weigh sixteen today that's,1,0
sw3065B-ms98-a,51,B,247.531125,257.037125,9.506,right  this line which is seventy three centimeters  just so you'll know but that would be good that i don't know,1,0
sw3066A-ms98-a,98,A,337.117,340.304875,3.187875,well then what daddy has must be a  too because_1 it's,1,0
sw3066B-ms98-a,29,B,77.9025,85.766125,7.863625,but you know what it what surprises me my neighbor has um Dalmatians and they want to be in your lap just like little puppies do ,1,0
sw3066B-ms98-a,36,B,100.084625,105.87475,5.790125,yes i'm sure it is you just never know where you are going to be do you  oh,1,0
sw3066B-ms98-a,95,B,343.6985,351.124,7.4255,and that's how my are and then you know even though they are miniature they can be large for their size or small for their size,1,0
sw3066B-ms98-a,112,B,404.22775,418.198,13.97025,and i didn't think i would be able to sell them_1 when they were three months old but it was amazing i have a i have an enclosed patio and so that's where i kept the dogs and there's a doggie door they can go in and out into the backyard that's fenced so the mother trained the puppies,1,0
sw3067A-ms98-a,42,A,188.6545,192.536625,3.882125,wh- why why do you think that it's less close than it used to be,1,0
sw3067B-ms98-a,13,B,69.2075,79.525875,10.318375, we rent a pavilion and and do that and that's usually works out to be pretty good uh they will rent a  pavilion on a weekend and uh ,1,0
sw3067B-ms98-a,34,B,178.737125,189.784,11.046875,and so uh it's not quite as close as it used to be so i think people feel less of a of a desire to really go i know that,1,0
sw3067B-ms98-a,41,B,231.290625,238.20375,6.913125,you know anywhere near one another and i don't think they feel the the the closeness that they that used to be there,1,0
sw3068A-ms98-a,25,A,99.081625,104.16025,5.078625,some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer but some of the,1,0
sw3068A-ms98-a,32,A,134.212875,144.427,10.214125,one of the reasons is because you know the kid doesn't know exactly what they want and i always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not going to be your career vocation,1,0
sw3068A-ms98-a,33,A,144.427,158.87475,14.44775,because you'll get better grades i- i think most employers would probably rather hire you know a a three six in um  in history uh to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration,1,0
sw3068A-ms98-a,69,A,351.75075,359.0105,7.25975,and when i now i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs i was going to be a teacher i was just a high school teacher so,1,0
sw3068A-ms98-a,72,A,378.159625,388.58675,10.427125,so i think yeah that's important um  i think it depends on if you want to be a if you want a regional job or a national job you need that first job or so out of school too,1,0
sw3068B-ms98-a,39,B,250.15025,261.67625,11.526,yeah yeah i think uh i would agree with that in fact the thing that i'm going through the same thing where in graduate school i was trying to choose you know a particular institution might be better,1,0
sw3068B-ms98-a,42,B,277.3455,285.644,8.2985,my quality of education might not be that much better but it's the same thing as you know what will the name recognition get me kind of thing,1,0
sw3069A-ms98-a,37,A,118.083,119.931875,1.848875,i'll be darned,1,0
sw3069A-ms98-a,48,A,141.6755,143.318375,1.642875,i'll be darned,1,0
sw3069A-ms98-a,66,A,221.691,224.5685,2.8775,right i wouldn't be surprised yeah,1,0
sw3069A-ms98-a,68,A,232.9895,239.567375,6.577875,when if if i have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or you know when i know i'm not going to be doing anything for a while um,1,0
sw3069A-ms98-a,70,A,250.536625,262.03475,11.498125,it's kind of a journal of of the history of ideas that's that's starting to be published um from UTD the first issue doesn't come out until next year but um i'm doing some reviews of books just to,1,0
sw3069A-ms98-a,71,A,262.03475,272.56575,10.531,what to sort of recommend to  well whether not a full-scale review should be done for the journal and i've yeah it's really neat because_1 these are brand new books and i just got a i got a th- this one,1,0
sw3069A-ms98-a,76,A,312.729375,326.324625,13.59525,that music to be a musician was as much um of a family occupation as anything i mean you know that was it was families had just loads of musicians  yeah that's right,1,0
sw3069A-ms98-a,80,A,334.521125,349.20225,14.681125,you know that's kind of what but i have to not only am am i rea- reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also um because the board of advisors for this um journal doesn't have right now doesn't have a really respected name um who's a,1,0
sw3069A-ms98-a,81,A,349.20225,358.78375,9.5815,um a scholar on on music um and  i'm supposed to decide whether i think this man might be a worthy person to be a you know in that position on the board so,2,0
sw3069A-ms98-a,95,A,438.7165,449.77875,11.06225,oh well let me tell you there are days when i would be prefer be r- really doing that  i don't know if i've told you but um this is not on the subject,2,0
sw3069B-ms98-a,65,B,297.013375,302.0315,5.018125,oh it's a brand new book oh that that would be wonderful to read something like that,1,0
sw3069B-ms98-a,79,B,363.966125,372.72425,8.758125,yeah well that's a neat thing to be involved in because_1 i think our i think my alma mater um Gettysburg i think they were just starting a magazine,1,0
sw3069B-ms98-a,99,B,433.124125,447.801125,14.677,boy you really lift me up to a  i mean here i i'm dealing with uh cleaning the stove and you know i'm  i wish i were dealing with Baudelaire  that'd be nice  but i,1,0
sw3070B-ms98-a,13,B,27.50775,35.05775,7.55,well it might be a good time for you to be- to to start a tradition you could be responsible for that yourself,3,0
sw3070B-ms98-a,20,B,68.598125,76.379125,7.781,Texas and uh that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family,1,0
sw3070B-ms98-a,27,B,105.336,112.789375,7.453375,let's see that would make them grandfather great grandfather great great grandfather okay so it would be the second great grandchild,1,0

sw3074B-ms98-a,79,B,408.53675,416.430125,7.893375,i i think the big question too we're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled,2,0
sw3075A-ms98-a,50,A,238.99075,246.35675,7.366,that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know i really came to love San Diego and feel very comfortable there they've been there eight years,1,0

sw3075B-ms98-a,67,B,305.30925,307.328,2.01875,so that will be hard to stay away from,1,0
sw3076A-ms98-a,49,A,192.347875,196.29625,3.948375, prepare them to be victims yes yeah,1,0
sw3076B-ms98-a,66,B,308.4525,323.14225,14.68975,mud and muddier campaigns i mean it's just i think that eventually the you know the better people have the sensibilities and they vote on those people who are least likely to do damage unfortunately that's not always the way it should be,1,0
sw3077A-ms98-a,57,A,274.08575,282.326375,8.240625,but i think they should still go back and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy,1,0
sw3077A-ms98-a,61,A,295.661625,308.885,13.223375,i don't care how much they take off of you you know you're still going to be above on top and i you know like you said i i've worked in different places and the ones that get the most pay do the least work,1,0
sw3077A-ms98-a,67,A,351.4345,363.784375,12.349875,and then the more i think about it the more i think i'm paying in to something that i granted you know i'm paying for my grandparents but i'm never going to see that social security is going to be gone before i ever get any,1,0
sw3077B-ms98-a,13,B,62.274625,77.21375,14.939125,it's starting to show um in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded and and i don't know if Texas is ever going to be able to to um totally avoid having an income tax or not i think eventually they're going to have to do it,1,0
sw3077B-ms98-a,34,B,200.256,211.535875,11.279875,and she said it's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of you know accumulating receipts can't do oh really,1,0
sw3077B-ms98-a,69,B,363.12125,370.3435,7.22225,yeah yes or what's left is not going to be worth anything um you know in terms of how you can actually use it,1,0
sw3077B-ms98-a,73,B,375.557875,387.686125,12.12825,that's right yeah yeah that's i haven't heard much um in recent years um about social security i mean for a while there not too long ago they were they were saying that the the whole system was going to be um bankrupt,1,0
sw3077B-ms98-a,74,B,387.686125,396.945375,9.25925,you know before very long because so much was going out for programs that were it wa- that originally it was never intended to be used for or you know programs just weren't in existence and um,1,0
sw3077B-ms98-a,76,B,404.551875,411.323625,6.77175,yeah well um i don't know i guess we complain about taxes but i guess you know uh you have to be sort of,1,0
sw3077B-ms98-a,79,B,418.63,433.050375,14.420375,i guess it's it's worse you know i'd rather s- be able s- to control my money as much as i do with what's left over after taxes than to live in oh England or um some some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all,1,0
sw3078A-ms98-a,18,A,121.20775,136.065,14.85725,uh she portrayed as a male and the nurse well i'm just i'm just thinking of pictures that i've seen and and you know uh uh i- i suspect no no message was ever intended to be while what you have to be this gender,2,0
sw3078A-ms98-a,55,A,400.6175,411.685,11.0675, she can pick whatever she wants to be and if she would like to be the traditional Cinderella and find that prince that's okay too but there,2,0
sw3078B-ms98-a,18,B,76.465875,90.354875,13.889,you know nobody ever said well you could only be a secretary or a nurse to me i mean you know my my parents were very strong and said you can do whatever you want to do so i got really lucky there but it's real funny i have a niece and a nephew now and my nephew is,1,0
sw3078B-ms98-a,19,B,90.354875,104.09625,13.741375,seven years old and something was said about my niece being a doctor and he said well she can't be a doctor she can only be a nurse  i thought golly you're seven years old and you're already opinionated ,2,0
sw3078B-ms98-a,34,B,162.008,163.71825,1.71025,be a teacher,1,0

sw3079A-ms98-a,68,A,309.975625,319.99675,10.021125,so if you're really honest about inputting everything that you spend your money on you'd be you you're really surprised at like boy you know i spend a whole lot of money on like candy or something you know  and ,1,0
sw3079B-ms98-a,61,B,262.44975,266.470625,4.020875,uh they're going to they're building a new one that's going to be even closer,1,0
sw3080A-ms98-a,14,A,31.05925,39.107625,8.048375,well um that's a hard question to answer because i do physical things but i don't always set out for them to be exercise,1,0
sw3081A-ms98-a,23,A,125.479,136.616125,11.137125,where you don't want to be always in the kitchen it's easy and she said it's they said it's good so that that's always sounds good to me um i feel like i feel like i'm in the kitchen cooking a lot ,1,0
sw3081A-ms98-a,27,A,150.694125,153.490375,2.79625, but a time consuming place to be,1,0
sw3081A-ms98-a,65,A,351.46275,357.061,5.59825,mo- sometimes it seems to be cheaper too so we often buy the we buy the,1,0
sw3081B-ms98-a,10,B,54.858,69.7035,14.8455,must be some Italian spices in there i can't remember but um for the cheese part you mix uh sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese,1,0
sw3081B-ms98-a,81,B,379.8685,386.32275,6.45425,i don't know there's supposed to be something more healthy about it  poultry instead of the beef and,1,0
sw3082A-ms98-a,10,A,36.159375,44.210625,8.05125,and in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood and now it's Lake Texoma because that's more central location for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to,1,0
sw3082A-ms98-a,56,A,265.272,270.23475,4.96275,yes it is  i- i- i don't really care for her to be president again ,1,0
sw3082A-ms98-a,64,A,288.435125,302.860625,14.4255,and this year they're all excited the the show this weekend this weekend is going to be a rock and roll show my two grandsons and one of their cousins are are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know in jeans and T-shirts and such ,1,0
sw3082A-ms98-a,65,A,302.860625,306.743375,3.88275, so it's uh it's going to be exciting for them and for us too,1,0
sw3082B-ms98-a,4,B,6.57075,9.623625,3.052875,oh are you really where is it going to be,1,0
sw3082B-ms98-a,16,B,43.11625,48.786375,5.670125,i'm sure location is really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be,1,0
sw3082B-ms98-a,57,B,218.6905,229.37,10.6795,oh it would be more yeah yeah that that is a problem with the distance the the people that we have that don't come are out El Paso way and it's just too much for all of them ,1,0
sw3082B-ms98-a,59,B,231.9245,239.7515,7.827,but then we have the same attitude when it's out there although this year we're going out they're going to have it at Fort Davis and we thought that would be,1,0
sw3083A-ms98-a,30,A,212.6335,224.649625,12.016125,that might be more well to well off you know going to a private Catholic school or whatever uh and and they're not all that way but you know some that are um,1,0
sw3083A-ms98-a,36,A,276.406875,286.86475,10.457875,uh uh an education it shows i think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know and that may be,1,0
sw3083A-ms98-a,39,A,303.660375,314.839875,11.1795,trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller uh they may be able to to give the resources that's needed to uh to do a good job,2,0
sw3083A-ms98-a,56,A,418.4095,431.355125,12.945625,trying to instill those values is kind of hard when uh when when you're growing up in you know in a home which may be uh just the pits and uh,1,0
sw3083A-ms98-a,58,A,442.548625,449.8795,7.330875,you barely have anything yourself so i could see where that would be a problem and i think that's i think it's there are oth-,1,0
sw3083B-ms98-a,2,B,3.126375,10.09175,6.965375,the biggest problem well like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools,1,0
sw3084A-ms98-a,76,A,359.005125,370.58575,11.580625,well you know maybe maybe there should just be um laws or something that the builders specifications that they have to do,1,0
sw3084B-ms98-a,16,B,50.312,52.935,2.623,not be caught shorthanded,1,0
sw3084B-ms98-a,78,B,314.619,320.618375,5.999375,no wonder you know the hail damage is so extensive and and things like that where it shouldn't be,1,0
sw3085A-ms98-a,23,A,110.1785,117.16,6.9815,which is all our school provides for the you know for the under three year old but still they have an opp- an opportunity to be with other children ,1,0
sw3085A-ms98-a,37,A,194.11075,197.604,3.49325,and they have to be there at sometimes six o'clock in the morning,1,0
sw3085B-ms98-a,18,B,77.089,90.85475,13.76575,it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups simply because that's the way our young people are are dealt with they're dealt with in packages,1,0
sw3085B-ms98-a,37,B,171.41475,174.08375,2.669,in order to be in that environment,1,0
sw3085B-ms98-a,42,B,185.549875,196.4355,10.885625,um-hum  well they ask so much of those caretakers for the amount that that they they pay they are to be there ahead of time you know they're there early to receive the kids ,1,0
sw3085B-ms98-a,43,B,196.4355,207.600875,11.165375,that's right and then then they have to work until the shop until the place closes at six P M and then it's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because_1 they don't have cleaning crews in most of those,1,0
sw3085B-ms98-a,56,B,262.12725,274.17675,12.0495,good a quality as i can provide for them however they're going out into the school environment now they're under a lot of other influences i need to be here for them i need to be involved in their school because i want to be the one,3,0
sw3085B-ms98-a,75,B,409.022125,415.283,6.260875,had a good concern for them and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the Y and taught to swim,1,0
sw3086A-ms98-a,66,A,254.30775,266.297875,11.990125,uh-huh so it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal   because there's a lot of background noise that you know people can hear so it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up um,2,0
sw3087A-ms98-a,55,A,188.5825,192.007375,3.424875,i would love to be able to go see Les Miserables,1,0
sw3087A-ms98-a,64,A,222.96625,226.00525,3.039,i would love to be able to go see those,1,0
sw3087A-ms98-a,102,A,366.948625,371.01175,4.063125,oh yeah well those should be good albums,1,0
sw3087B-ms98-a,41,B,170.458375,180.19,9.731625,and um he's coming to Dallas on the twenty ninth and we got a big group going down to hear him sing a bunch of uh Andrew Lloyd Webber's music so that'll be good,1,0
sw3088B-ms98-a,5,B,23.190875,30.3945,7.203625,i i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions and i think if if uh,1,0
sw3088B-ms98-a,6,B,30.3945,41.712875,11.318375,an employer feels that he wants to to drug test employees and they don't like it then they should not be employed there  that was you know i would not mind it,1,0
sw3088B-ms98-a,14,B,93.035375,95.836875,2.8015,and as an employer i would think that would be,1,0
sw3088B-ms98-a,15,B,95.836875,104.959,9.122125,and the first it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost there there's no way but but my concern is uh school bus drivers ,1,0
sw3088B-ms98-a,24,B,130.052625,136.737125,6.6845,right but when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus or,1,0
sw3088B-ms98-a,25,B,136.737125,149.31775,12.580625,a train um and it doesn't take that long uh they they don't have be totally roaring drunk just a little off on their timing could could mean life,1,0
sw3088B-ms98-a,50,B,230.79875,242.23425,11.4355,so i i i would really rather know however there's got to be some backup to say that if if somebody does observe you at say at a party,1,0
sw3088B-ms98-a,51,B,242.23425,248.617375,6.383125,uh using drugs i would think that it would be their obligation to report that,1,0
sw3088B-ms98-a,58,B,265.917375,275.806125,9.88875,well i don't know what kind of work you do but there there would be even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way and,2,0
sw3088B-ms98-a,86,B,385.6985,388.70075,3.00225,they they just don't want to be drug tested,1,0
sw3088B-ms98-a,88,B,390.872125,398.19275,7.320625,you know we've never my husband and i have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested,1,0
sw3089A-ms98-a,18,A,70.69275,76.209875,5.517125,yeah that's definitely what i want to do but i think by then that might even be at the dollar movies,1,0
sw3089A-ms98-a,47,A,171.65925,173.560625,1.901375,that'd be neat,1,0
sw3089A-ms98-a,57,A,202.38225,204.5185,2.13625,huh well that would be neat,1,0
sw3089A-ms98-a,74,A,275.719,278.88225,3.16325,but um Backdraft is supposed to be really good,1,0
sw3089B-ms98-a,66,B,270.110125,274.87,4.759875,no no that'd be the last one on our list ,1,0
sw3090A-ms98-a,78,A,325.631,338.232875,12.601875,that it was worth it to save and then not have uh something and uh in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it so uh it really makes it easier but uh well i've enjoyed talking with you Jay ,1,0
sw3090A-ms98-a,87,A,370.09425,378.546,8.45175,oh you're kidding well i'm going to be teaching at Brookhaven in the fall  Kuenzer K U E N Z E R and i'm i'm going to,1,0

sw3090B-ms98-a,14,B,79.8215,87.141625,7.320125,so uh you know it's his life but uh i i would i think it'd be smart if somebody would keep uh,1,0
sw3090B-ms98-a,36,B,215.993875,225.838375,9.8445,yeah well then you never know how they'll one they they may s- flip flop when they get to be uh ol- well older the other one may be very careful and,2,0
sw3090B-ms98-a,37,B,225.838375,238.152875,12.3145,she may marry somebody and of course it'd be good because if you marry somebody a little loose then she'll have that stability of watching uh you should have one in the in the in the house and i think,1,0
sw3091A-ms98-a,24,A,91.323125,98.276,6.952875,i've heard of that i've heard several people say that so it must really be i think it's part Vietnamese or something,1,0
sw3091A-ms98-a,51,A,229.708375,236.438375,6.73,well i have not been to the old one for that matter but i thought that since there's a new one opening perhaps it'd be easier to get into,1,0
sw3091A-ms98-a,57,A,257.179625,262.497375,5.31775,well that's fine for the summer but i don't think i'd be too interested in the winter ,1,0
sw3092A-ms98-a,11,A,79.084375,84.363,5.278625,um probably dental how important you think that would be,1,0
sw3092A-ms98-a,13,A,91.219,97.57675,6.35775,because they and course if you did not have them you would be pulling from your salary of course right right,1,0
sw3092A-ms98-a,16,A,107.527375,118.71925,11.191875,we could not do without the benefit package from from any company that we worked for whether they be a conglomerate or just a small uh uh business,1,0
sw3092A-ms98-a,37,A,185.906125,187.57525,1.669125,it would be just futile,1,0
sw3092A-ms98-a,41,A,192.19225,194.661625,2.469375,and they would be deprived of their mother,1,0
sw3092A-ms98-a,56,A,233.46225,235.26575,1.8035,do you think that would be,1,0
sw3092A-ms98-a,71,A,255.4435,256.916625,1.473125,that would be fair,1,0
sw3092B-ms98-a,23,B,126.296875,131.329625,5.03275,exactly you  you wouldn't be pulling it out of your account all of the time,1,0
sw3092B-ms98-a,32,B,176.568,186.914375,10.346375,from ages nine to two and it it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that i would be making would be going to day care,2,0
sw3092B-ms98-a,33,B,186.914375,195.1375,8.223125,and it it would be just basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care center which is not right exactly,3,0
sw3092B-ms98-a,35,B,196.585625,209.238875,12.65325,besides which it would be easier uh there's a lot of single mothers out there now from divorces and a lot of women are starting to have babies without a partner and to go to work,1,0
sw3092B-ms98-a,39,B,234.39325,247.824875,13.431625,i think tha- i think it would be fair i think if if the company could not provide it all on their own for the for the people that would be using it you know a a a certain amount of their salary would go to it but it would still probably be cheaper,3,0
sw3092B-ms98-a,42,B,254.0945,256.562625,2.468125,i think it would be really really great,1,0
sw3092B-ms98-a,49,B,274.74975,276.98075,2.231,it would be great i mean,1,0
sw3092B-ms98-a,57,B,296.107875,305.384,9.276125,well she does not have it but she is like on the verge of it or something her eyes are changing and she has to be tested periodically and and those are expensive tests,1,0
sw3093A-ms98-a,5,A,18.483125,29.198625,10.7155,maybe maybe as the summer heat comes along i'd sort of like going somewhere where it's not so hot and being able to be outside and enjoy  -side activities so,1,0
sw3093A-ms98-a,7,A,40.04825,53.647625,13.599375,oh well let's see we have plans this year to drive up to the uh to Colorado and we'll be going to Estes Park and Colorado Springs so,1,0
sw3093A-ms98-a,54,A,346.478375,351.125,4.646625,so that'll be interesting turn on vacations for our family,1,0
sw3093A-ms98-a,58,A,363.701875,368.5595,4.857625,and uh in and in the summer would be more like a two month,1,0
sw3093B-ms98-a,22,B,98.879125,107.275375,8.39625,uh we haven't had a vacation in several years s- so  be our first chance in a- in awhile uh,1,0
sw3094A-ms98-a,3,A,3.987625,16.480875,12.49325,well i- i tend to be a a uh sports news and uh not very many of the modern sitcoms,1,0
sw3094A-ms98-a,68,A,402.9745,411.6105,8.636,well you know LA Law seems to be real hot and in fact because of the particular business i'm in i'm not a lawyer but i work with lawyers a lot,1,0
sw3094A-ms98-a,69,A,411.6105,420.72975,9.11925,and the lawyers seem to be very much into watching it and uh yet i again i have to say because of uh ,1,0
sw3094B-ms98-a,10,B,56.327875,64.350375,8.0225,and uh i just uh i like you know enjoy the horror or the mystery or whatever just kind of seeing you know what the twist would be and uh,1,0
sw3094B-ms98-a,29,B,131.544125,142.049,10.504875,w- that's uh i don't do it so much n- i guess in the last year or so but before that i w- at the same time thing because_1 you're happen to be in front of the TV at a certain time i was watching Jeop- uh Jeopardy ,1,0
sw3094B-ms98-a,33,B,158.835375,173.281125,14.44575,i really enjoy it it's uh it's uh you know i thought that i really liked the old Star Trek and this Star Trek uh is so much better you know of course the uh special effects are better and the the story lines just seem to be really good and it's it's uh i really like it enjoy it,1,0
sw3095A-ms98-a,2,A,0.367125,10.869625,10.5025,i guess we are just to discuss trials and and punishment if it's to be given by the judge or not did you did you catch your explanation of that okay,1,0
sw3095A-ms98-a,57,A,342.880875,345.404625,2.52375,people have to be involved,1,0
sw3095B-ms98-a,3,B,12.363875,25.98925,13.625375,maybe i'm a hard liner but i think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases rather than uh degrees of ,1,0
sw3095B-ms98-a,15,B,174.991125,183.606125,8.615,whereas uh i think that's those that should be in jail should be in jail ,2,0
sw3095B-ms98-a,30,B,280.40075,290.824875,10.424125,it'd get to the she was sentenced to jail but then due to technicalities she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced,1,0
sw3095B-ms98-a,54,B,428.485,438.33225,9.84725,well another side of the coin that with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court there are a lot of things that could be settled out of court,1,0
sw3096A-ms98-a,5,A,10.657125,21.724875,11.06775,oh yeah i yeah i think so yeah there's been a lot of changes i think there's still uh a lot to be made though  um-hum,1,0
sw3096A-ms98-a,13,A,43.056,46.52175,3.46575,what would be classified as a man's job,1,0
sw3096B-ms98-a,13,B,55.249375,64.341625,9.09225,yes um yes in years past i know in fact even even the the word drafter is has uh changed because it used to be they were draftsman ,1,0
sw3096B-ms98-a,23,B,129.253625,138.631625,9.378,of the board are women in this country and and i thought that you know that's pretty si- a pretty significantly small number so there are some some strides to be made there,1,0
sw3096B-ms98-a,30,B,186.356125,200.46475,14.108625,she's definitely entering into uh a male profession but uh but you know now for instance there are there is uh the organization women uh the Society of Women Engineers so that is recognized as uh you know a place where women should be,1,0
sw3096B-ms98-a,32,B,213.98875,221.484125,7.495375,it'll be interesting to see if if uh Roman Catholicism ever um uh recognizes women in in the role of priest,1,0
sw3096B-ms98-a,38,B,251.97175,256.7485,4.77675,found wanting or you know or not re-  as highly regarded as men would be,1,0
sw3096B-ms98-a,43,B,300.17225,313.774625,13.602375,uh one of one of the men who was uh i do not know if he was a general or you know what his rank was very high he said it's just a personal thing with me i mean i can't be real you know i can not tell you why i feel this way but i just would rather have uh a man doing some of these jobs than a woman,1,0
sw3096B-ms98-a,47,B,324.669375,334.76,10.090625,you know now well now as far as i am concerned and now i could be wrong about this but the only one area where a woman couldn't do it is if she just physically did not have the strength to do something,1,0
sw3096B-ms98-a,48,B,334.76,347.527875,12.767875,uh because i would think i think you know mentally um and emotionally i think that women can handle a job and every bit as well so anyway it's it'll be interesting to see where it all goes,1,0
sw3096B-ms98-a,52,B,353.53825,364.996625,11.458375,no i agree but i am sure that there are women who would would relish that you know kind of an a job so uh i guess that should be taken into consideration as well so,1,0
sw3097A-ms98-a,15,A,51.531875,62.82825,11.296375,even even raising boys today is different though because they are expected to do so much more than they used to you know used to be they would just go off to work and come home and you know everything was done and it ,1,0
sw3097A-ms98-a,98,A,403.86075,416.05,12.18925,and she said it's amazing she said you know every single person in this family expects me to get and they dra- suck me into these arguments and these conversations and i ha- i am supposed to be,1,0
sw3097B-ms98-a,4,B,9.352125,21.216875,11.86475,women of my age my generation were trained and taught and brought up to be the Leave It to Beaver housewives but we are not living in that world,1,0
sw3097B-ms98-a,10,B,43.0335,48.96275,5.92925,and i really would be at a loss to to raise and train a girl i think i would,1,0
sw3097B-ms98-a,35,B,102.0275,107.474375,5.446875,i did very much the same thing until my boys got into high school and said mom please do not be involved,1,0
sw3097B-ms98-a,57,B,192.632125,200.94425,8.312125,diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases heart disease was characteristic of men now there's almost equally predominant in women,1,0
sw3097B-ms98-a,59,B,202.434625,214.66125,12.226625,uh-huh uh-huh right and i think that that's a that's a symptom of our society it's a symptom that there's there's a general illness that needs to be healed,1,0
sw3097B-ms98-a,60,B,214.66125,221.501375,6.840125,i do not know what the healing process would be or what was causing the problem i am not i am not God,1,0
sw3097B-ms98-a,62,B,225.337625,237.042125,11.7045,i really did meet a lot of pressures saying you know you need to get them into music lessons you need to get them into sports you need to get them into this they need to be busy and they need to be active,2,0
sw3097B-ms98-a,63,B,237.042125,249.89025,12.848125,and i fought all of those things i said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me and they will say mom this is important to me i want to do it otherwise i will guard  their ability to have quiet time,1,0
sw3097B-ms98-a,92,B,338.932625,348.464125,9.5315,and i was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help i helped them with exactly what they asked for and that's all,1,0
sw3097B-ms98-a,97,B,362.9995,370.261375,7.261875,they are intellectual cripples and so are children they do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible for themselves,1,0
sw3097B-ms98-a,113,B,420.41075,430.294875,9.884125,you know i think that's one of the things that we have today that is very useful and i think every woman ought to deal with it or ought to at least be exposed to it and that is mediation training,1,0
sw3098A-ms98-a,4,A,3.3285,6.867,3.5385,we are supposed to be talking about children and spending time with them today,1,0
sw3098A-ms98-a,5,A,6.867,17.426125,10.559125,neither one of us have any children but it might be interesting if we talked about what we thought we would do if we had children or perhaps you know what some of our friends do and what we approve or do not approve of,1,0
sw3098A-ms98-a,10,A,60.183875,62.701875,2.518,it will be fun though,1,0
sw3098A-ms98-a,44,A,228.525625,238.221875,9.69625,it's just one of those kind of deals that she spends a lot of time with him she listens to what he has to say and he is turning out he is thirteen he is turning out to be a really good kid,1,0
sw3098A-ms98-a,49,A,260.355375,263.049875,2.6945,um which may be part of the reason we never had kids,1,0
sw3098B-ms98-a,7,B,30.695875,40.24225,9.546375,you know that's going to be the closest nieces and nephews that we can come up with is our cousins kids  they do not live close to us but uh,1,0
sw3098B-ms98-a,9,B,52.2775,61.312375,9.034875,things sometime you get to be the uh the tourist folks and we will take them to Six Flags take them to Wet N Wild i mean they may not be real quality  but,2,0
sw3098B-ms98-a,10,B,61.312375,69.583625,8.27125,yeah it will be a real treat for them you know to kind of come and do that because they live in East Texas so they will be something real out of the norm,2,0
sw3098B-ms98-a,52,B,288.77875,295.450875,6.672125,and i i like it now that people make the decision you know okay i am going to be married,1,0
sw3098B-ms98-a,62,B,351.495125,360.511625,9.0165,i could have children and and cope with it i have too many bad feelings with my own childhood and maybe i will turn out to be you know abusive like my mother was,1,0
sw3099A-ms98-a,17,A,53.206875,64.581375,11.3745,yeah well hopefully i can do some consulting work at home and if i can do that it will yeah i'll be able to spend the time with my daughter and not have to worry too much about child care,1,0
sw3099A-ms98-a,25,A,95.55,102.560875,7.010875,i wouldn't want her to be into a in a large day care situation so young because_1 i think a little infant just doesn't get the stimulation they need,1,0
sw3099A-ms98-a,43,A,209.62275,221.6465,12.02375,i'll probably be going back to work around January whereas she'll be about eight or nine months old and so i think you know she'll be at a i have heard it's a roughage to put them into a,3,0
sw3099A-ms98-a,57,A,289.51175,292.871,3.35925,well if i work part time that might be doable,1,0
sw3099A-ms98-a,61,A,328.3915,342.739625,14.348125,and you know maybe do some freelance type work from home and so if i go back to work on a part time basis i'm hoping i can leave my daughter with her because_1 her daughter you know again will be a couple of months,1,0
sw3099A-ms98-a,62,A,342.739625,357.734125,14.9945,my daughter will be about six months older than hers and you know it'll be a little rough when she is a very very little infant but like when she is a month or so my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with babysitting for large families and so uh,2,0
sw3099A-ms98-a,63,A,357.734125,370.233875,12.49975,she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day and we coul- might even be able to do it on a trade off basis that i watch their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever or if she wants an afternoon off even if she wants an afternoon just to work,2,0
sw3099A-ms98-a,64,A,370.233875,374.33575,4.101875,uh and not be bothered we might be able to exchange that way,2,0
sw3099A-ms98-a,73,A,418.58675,426.6695,8.08275,yeah well she's my daughter doesn't seem to be on a real schedule yet and it's probably my fault because_1 i do not have a real schedule now but,1,0
sw3099B-ms98-a,16,B,59.293625,62.516625,3.223,oh that would be wonderful right,1,0
sw3099B-ms98-a,55,B,224.95875,238.452,13.49325,i think it it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying so it you know it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place but that's unusual,1,0
sw3099B-ms98-a,77,B,337.471375,340.364625,2.89325,oh that would be wonderful,1,0
sw3099B-ms98-a,95,B,389.903875,403.504625,13.60075,really well trained people right and have have some kind of real good program set up so that you when you go you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows CPR or first aid or,1,0
sw3100A-ms98-a,18,A,95.218125,104.322625,9.1045,when they were your parents age they were doing much better now it's gotten to where it's just barely and we know it's going to be probably,1,0
sw3100A-ms98-a,24,A,140.626875,155.619,14.992125,and so the nursing home there if if they had to go there there would be some of their old friends there you know and it's and rather than in a city where you probably wouldn't know anyone so that would be to their,2,0
sw3100A-ms98-a,53,A,387.8995,394.724875,6.825375,and then and then it's our  so we better  better handle it     be ,1,0

sw3100B-ms98-a,36,B,294.25625,308.7245,14.46825,well if they're uh that's the thing if they're physically able it is a much more pleasant more caring uh situation to be in the home of one of the children,1,0
sw3100B-ms98-a,50,B,401.8735,411.7185,9.845,uh may not be as workable for us it it's certainly a problem as we as people live older of course as long as you can live a healthy life uh ,1,0
sw3101A-ms98-a,21,A,54.66525,57.974375,3.309125,yeah that would be difficult where did you see the boat,1,0

sw3101A-ms98-a,101,A,387.48,395.15475,7.67475,so but it's well worth it when we do get to go and hopefully it will be good weather this weekend so we can go,1,0
sw3101B-ms98-a,25,B,74.97725,76.672,1.69475,oh that'd be great,1,0

sw3102B-ms98-a,127,B,414.124375,418.583625,4.45925,and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it,1,0
sw3103A-ms98-a,47,A,211.224,222.93175,11.70775,and uh i think that uh in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve and uh,1,0
sw3103A-ms98-a,51,A,248.11025,251.607375,3.497125,it could be if they are af- they are not sure of themselves,1,0

sw3103A-ms98-a,60,A,274.06875,281.51825,7.4495,i think that we are going to be uh on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term,1,0
sw3103A-ms98-a,64,A,300.1645,304.94325,4.77875,and uh i think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other,1,0
sw3103A-ms98-a,74,A,383.60225,388.138625,4.536375,the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands,1,0
sw3103A-ms98-a,76,A,390.76675,394.080625,3.313875,and uh but i think that they should be in harmony,1,0
sw3103A-ms98-a,78,A,397.176375,400.218625,3.04225,and i think the issue should be settled,1,0
sw3103A-ms98-a,83,A,420.1945,428.1685,7.974,i mean if your husband did that to you and you did that to your husband you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself,1,0
sw3103A-ms98-a,86,A,438.876625,441.2055,2.328875,that would be a beautiful,1,0
sw3103B-ms98-a,20,B,150.420375,156.733875,6.3135,and uh the choir members treat me differently because i am a woman they expect me to be more motherly,1,0
sw3103B-ms98-a,69,B,325.82,339.63775,13.81775,uh it just seems that it seems it seems that they are more comfortable that way and i do not know if that's i mean that's it's a militaristic point of view i guess you know somebody can not be colonel and everybody else is infantry but it's just really interesting to me i am married to a wonderful man,1,0
sw3103B-ms98-a,70,B,339.63775,352.424,12.78625,you know who treats me very you know with a with as i think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time but when he gets angry it's always over control issues it's always over power issues,1,0
sw3103B-ms98-a,98,B,442.27,444.145625,1.875625,uh-huh it would be,1,0
sw3104A-ms98-a,47,A,156.648125,169.492625,12.8445,and he would probably be flying is what he would be doing uh but but right now of course he's he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut and they build and rebuild uh jet engines,2,0

sw3104B-ms98-a,45,B,330.623375,334.494125,3.87075,much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a uh,1,0
sw3105A-ms98-a,37,A,205.696125,218.96925,13.273125,uh do you feel like there's any certain type of crime that this should be the result this should be consequences of is capital punishment or or are are there some murders that committed that you think th- leniency should be shown,3,0
sw3105A-ms98-a,55,A,333.40325,335.551875,2.148625,that would be ,1,0
sw3105B-ms98-a,30,B,143.938,150.56975,6.63175,i think that uh you know that there needs to be a way that you know once someone,1,0
sw3105B-ms98-a,34,B,159.824625,165.212875,5.38825,there should be a limit on how many appeals can be made you know when someone has been,2,0
sw3105B-ms98-a,43,B,187.095375,194.004875,6.9095,to have convictions overturned and then they have to be retried and all that it's such a waste of time and energy and money,1,0
sw3105B-ms98-a,44,B,194.004875,205.1015,11.096625,and it just that's what keeps that's what's keeping all the the you know the the criminals in a position of being able to be released all the time like this,1,0
sw3105B-ms98-a,52,B,244.3835,256.791375,12.407875,killing someone okay i could see that that might be a situation where uh the person could be rehabilitated but i think just out and out murder and i'm talking about uh,2,0
sw3105B-ms98-a,54,B,259.049,269.07225,10.02325,you know where there's shown to be pathological tendencies where this person has done it over and over again in a serial fashion or whatever,1,0
sw3105B-ms98-a,56,B,274.9425,279.365625,4.423125,needs to be addressed in in in that context,1,0
sw3105B-ms98-a,62,B,316.735375,326.641375,9.906,that i mean repeatedly uh during high school they had told their teachers that they were going to be that they were going to to graduate from high school and kill cops,1,0
sw3106A-ms98-a,5,A,6.480875,13.244,6.763125,i knew that was you  well this should be a good one your mother will like it,1,0
sw3106A-ms98-a,30,A,95.891625,107.040625,11.149,and uh that usually has the latest oh people in the world  very interesting and then i subscribe i bet you know what this one's going to be,1,0

sw3106B-ms98-a,89,B,378.976875,389.019875,10.043,you know it has good informative things in there for things your gonna be buying  at one time or other and you can save them and it's got like tax tips in it and stuff like that,1,0
sw3106B-ms98-a,92,B,414.208,427.48075,13.27275,saving for your children and and what to do and what not to do and how much the uh uh projected cost was going to be by the time like you know mine reached college age and stuff,1,0
sw3106B-ms98-a,93,B,427.48075,435.397625,7.916875,and it's going to be pretty darn expensive and and it was saying you know what to you know how you could go about putting,1,0
sw3107A-ms98-a,21,A,130.729375,143.648875,12.9195,so we go there anyway so they're they're so if they were to bill which which i believe they don't but if they were to bill the HMO for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing but they're not thank God um,1,0
sw3107B-ms98-a,10,B,60.3535,65.072625,4.719125,okay but but on the other hand  one of these days you'll be out looking for a,1,0
sw3107B-ms98-a,49,B,410.9085,425.163125,14.254625,idea is that uh if if you have to pay a bigger share you'll you'll be more careful about spending the spending the money and and helping hold down the costs but uh uh i ,1,0
sw3108B-ms98-a,37,B,139.955375,145.323875,5.3685,it's it's fun it's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once,1,0
sw3108B-ms98-a,66,B,240.119125,244.541125,4.422,i think that's the one i wanted to pick up the other day and then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me,1,0
sw3109A-ms98-a,16,A,64.30475,69.641375,5.336625,eighty five are you going to be looking again soon or how long do you normally keep cars for a long time or,1,0
sw3109A-ms98-a,53,A,217.918875,222.089375,4.1705,    if anything did happen she was going to be all right but,1,0
sw3109A-ms98-a,90,A,363.035375,373.92925,10.893875,and it's got to be you know you can't get your leg out and so i- i thought i always you always see them standing by it you know if they're advertising they don't ever show them getting in and out,1,0
sw3109A-ms98-a,95,A,388.434,395.236375,6.802375,and and i don't even know if they i know for a while back i saw them advertise that and i thought that might be kind of a neat,1,0
sw3109B-ms98-a,22,B,73.126125,80.25225,7.126125,i bought a houseboat and had other expenses so i'm not      position to be  a car right away,1,0
sw3109B-ms98-a,24,B,88.114125,90.385625,2.2715,seem to be running pretty good now,1,0
sw3109B-ms98-a,132,B,448.715375,455.672875,6.9575,oh i don't know but we're way we must be way above average this year because_1 it's been terrible just rain rain rain,1,0
sw3110A-ms98-a,107,A,436.4835,444.768625,8.285125,yeah they definitely are but it will be nice if we ever do have kids because_1 then i've got the whole wardrobes and fortunately she's had a boy and a girl,1,0

sw3110B-ms98-a,15,B,50.657625,59.11775,8.460125,uh no i think it needs to be longer probably if it's split it it varies though between the prin- from one principal to another,1,0
sw3110B-ms98-a,129,B,443.864625,449.241,5.376375,ooh yeah you'll be glad believe me oh because_1,1,0
sw3110B-ms98-a,140,B,478.4295,482.57375,4.14425,on the other hand  they can be pretty picky and you know,1,0
sw3110B-ms98-a,145,B,492.581875,497.137875,4.556,anything was fine but you know now it has to be a certain kind of,1,0
sw3110B-ms98-a,164,B,579.263,583.14225,3.87925,but i'll b- still be wearing them in ten  ,1,0
sw3111A-ms98-a,27,A,138.88025,141.63075,2.7505,inverse of what they should be like uh,1,0
sw3111A-ms98-a,48,A,257.41275,260.424,3.01125,it would certainly be an interesting test,1,0
sw3111B-ms98-a,85,B,337.11775,342.283125,5.165375,you know it really couldn't be a good test because Alaska's so different than every other part of the country,1,0
sw3113A-ms98-a,8,A,69.889625,82.130875,12.24125,yeah because_1 i find that uh i've been on a few juries and uh as a say i i tend to be around uh civil cases,1,0
sw3113B-ms98-a,6,B,43.422625,57.944,14.521375,right i agree too i don't think the jury should be the ones that that put the  sentencings down i think the judges should or even a panel of of lawyers if if it got to that point,1,0
sw3113B-ms98-a,7,B,57.944,62.253875,4.309875,might be better apt than just regular civil people,1,0
sw3113B-ms98-a,14,B,134.95275,149.4255,14.47275,right that's yeah an- and and most people that do sit on juries some people just sit on them once in their lifetime you know if they're that lucky sometimes  or you know what whatever the case may be and and may not have any idea,1,0
sw3113B-ms98-a,15,B,149.4255,162.9565,13.531,of what what the standard punishment would be for it and it they may have some different idea i mean it might be more important for them to put a sen- sen- sentencing down that was uh,2,0
sw3113B-ms98-a,17,B,167.5,172.068,4.568,or not long enough or you know whatever the case may be,1,0
sw3113B-ms98-a,20,B,197.818625,204.83875,7.020125,has has the right morals sometimes and people can be paid off or politically or,1,0
sw3113B-ms98-a,21,B,204.83875,209.85075,5.012,whatever the case may be and sometimes that's not real fair either though so,1,0
sw3113B-ms98-a,31,B,303.501125,316.61225,13.111125,then you should pay for whatever you did and and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge i don't i don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say oh well you know that was a breeze i can go out and do it again and you know,1,0
sw3113B-ms98-a,40,B,393.676375,407.56,13.883625,and to me how can you how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of whether it be whether it pertains to the case or not somebody thinks it it had because they've got it there,1,0
sw3114A-ms98-a,10,A,62.623875,66.057,3.433125,i what k- what what kind of means would those be,1,0
sw3114A-ms98-a,11,A,66.057,72.28225,6.22525,uh-huh in other words you're saying that it would be hard uh to get rid of all of the guns,1,0
sw3114A-ms98-a,18,A,89.810375,103.670625,13.86025,well it would be nice uh uh to be able to take your family out uh especially when they're dependent on you and not worry about uh having to have a gun just to protect yourself and them,2,0
sw3114A-ms98-a,32,A,186.70825,198.37575,11.6675,yeah so some- somewhere along the line then uh you know there has to be a happy medium and uh i know the the uh oh what's the organization that uh,1,0
sw3114B-ms98-a,37,B,181.263,185.281,4.018, you think we could ever get to that point where there would be no firearms,1,0
sw3115A-ms98-a,9,A,20.151375,23.72775,3.576375,but oh and and i haven't told you i'm going to be at a different school this year now,1,0
sw3115A-ms98-a,12,A,30.52475,41.4935,10.96875,right i well not really i've got the every day i've got to uh read to kindergartners so i'm going to be down on the floor with them i've got about forty kindergartners i'm going to be doing working with every day,2,0
sw3115A-ms98-a,13,A,41.4935,47.664875,6.171375,for uh you know a half hour so i'll be i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do,2,0
sw3115A-ms98-a,14,A,47.664875,55.63525,7.970375,because i'm i'm if i'm going to be down on the floor messing with them i'm not going to wear nylons and you know nice nylons and dresses,1,0
sw3115A-ms98-a,46,A,196.86,202.90175,6.04175,and there can be no blue jeans worn and because some of the teachers i know wear uh,1,0
sw3115A-ms98-a,80,A,377.031875,383.482625,6.45075,well i i think it would make a difference at school i i don't think we should be spending time,1,0
sw3115B-ms98-a,12,B,53.691375,63.9705,10.279125,what i wear sometimes depends on on how cold i think the school might be or what room i might be in since i'm a sub and have different rooms to go to and always carry a sweater,2,0
sw3115B-ms98-a,25,B,143.570125,147.266,3.695875,and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some,1,0
sw3115B-ms98-a,28,B,150.124375,163.917375,13.793,no but because i sort of stick to several schools uh i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and and might might remember to do it and then many schools on a particular day during uh,1,0
sw3115B-ms98-a,30,B,170.1875,175.6,5.4125,right it might be Thursday for the high schools and it may be Friday for the senior high schools,2,0
sw3115B-ms98-a,43,B,255.562875,264.127875,8.565,and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there you don't want to dress too tacky because you're  going to be in the same room with  ,1,0
sw3115B-ms98-a,47,B,272.246375,274.387,2.140625,or you're going to be observed,1,0
sw3115B-ms98-a,65,B,370.413625,376.48625,6.072625,well it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run i think that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe,1,0
sw3116A-ms98-a,6,A,68.361125,75.0795,6.718375,certainly tastes good i hate to uh pay any kind of an amount and then have the food be real mediocre,1,0
sw3116A-ms98-a,10,A,97.821,105.200625,7.379625,um i guess my favorite kind of f- foods would be uh the ones that,1,0
sw3116A-ms98-a,13,A,120.67625,124.49325,3.817,i always thought Texas was supposed to be such a good meat state,1,0
sw3116A-ms98-a,14,A,124.49325,130.494625,6.001375,and it seems to be a tough thing to do is to find a place that cooks up a real good juicy steak so,1,0
sw3116A-ms98-a,36,A,214.1495,220.400375,6.250875,be comfortable as a family or are we looking to spend a lot of time and a lot of money which doesn't work with kids,1,0
sw3117A-ms98-a,87,A,427.23925,436.282,9.04275,i had to be very careful about talking about seniors or fourth year students  you got to get the terminology right ,1,0
sw3117B-ms98-a,13,B,117.515,128.274375,10.759375,i think that for me it's going to be one of those things yes i want to make sure it has a good education but i also want to keep it small enough that you can enjoy it because Texas to me was almost too big,1,0
sw3118A-ms98-a,6,A,29.985875,34.223625,4.23775,now that do you do you agree that they should all be unanimous,1,0
sw3118A-ms98-a,8,A,36.785125,47.56675,10.781625,or even even in uh like they said you know lesser you know trials you know lesser convictions do you think that they should be all unanimous still,1,0
sw3118A-ms98-a,29,A,188.98475,199.481375,10.496625,yeah i agree i don't think it should be left up to the judge alone not only you know that they have to stay in there but hey how many times have you heard of judges being bought over,1,0
sw3118A-ms98-a,30,A,199.481375,211.86675,12.385375,you know so it it's i- i- i think i think in in the end the judge has the presiding you know um vote i think he can be you know,1,0
sw3118A-ms98-a,38,A,244.8305,249.579125,4.748625,oh oh my God if there were more than     how long they'd be sitting,1,0
sw3118A-ms98-a,45,A,274.28675,277.829875,3.543125,i- i don't know how it could be more fair,1,0
sw3118A-ms98-a,46,A,277.829875,285.052125,7.22225,course i don't know maybe maybe they should be asking someone that's been    ,1,0
sw3118A-ms98-a,58,A,317.43875,328.575375,11.136625,i just i don't know i- i guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail you know     it more fair for them or not but then again maybe they should be there so that is ,1,0
sw3118B-ms98-a,3,B,4.315,14.822125,10.507125,i haven't i don't know that much about the possi- what the possible  choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury but,1,0
sw3118B-ms98-a,6,B,22.736625,30.979375,8.24275,i can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide although it's difficult because they all have to be new unanimous,2,0
sw3118B-ms98-a,30,B,171.385875,181.872125,10.48625,so um but then again you know they the one of the questions they asked is should it just be decided by a judge and that's kind of tricky too because a lot of positions the judges are in they,1,0
sw3118B-ms98-a,31,B,181.872125,190.1905,8.318375,they can't be fired you know they have to they stay till they retire and  they're pretty partial in their judgements ,1,0
sw3118B-ms98-a,38,B,239.15675,246.172625,7.015875, maybe juries could be less than twelve people or would that be more fair or less fair maybe there should be more than twelve  i don't,3,0
sw3118B-ms98-a,46,B,279.789375,281.326625,1.53725,it could be ,1,0
sw3118B-ms98-a,49,B,295.870375,302.703375,6.833,the unanimous vote is questionable though and and how how many cases get juries might want to be reviewed too,1,0
sw3119A-ms98-a,12,A,41.4,44.71525,3.31525,curbside would be wonderful i'm ready ,1,0
sw3119A-ms98-a,15,A,56.16375,60.04775,3.884,and uh so that seems to be helping a little bit too,1,0
sw3119A-ms98-a,19,A,72.305375,79.86125,7.555875, that'd be great h- i am i'm not sure how a mulching mower works -oes it just chop it up finely or what,1,0
sw3119A-ms98-a,26,A,114.908375,118.780375,3.872,i've heard that that's um something that can be started,1,0
sw3119A-ms98-a,93,A,375.68,384.482,8.802,um and i i guess some companies are beginning to do some things uh to where part of the diaper can be recycled or degraded,1,0
sw3119B-ms98-a,4,B,15.5605,17.968875,2.408375,oh really that'd be neat,1,0
sw3119B-ms98-a,8,B,30.05,41.35,11.3,well i'm i l- fortunately live live pr- pretty close to the Wal-Mart and there's a pretty good size recycle center behind the Wal-Mart so it's convenient for me to do it but curbside would be much more convenient,1,0
sw3119B-ms98-a,30,B,143.747,152.38,8.633,has m- sent out a memo to everybody in her company that says if you're sending out interoffice memos it's got to be on the backside of a paper that's already been used,1,0
sw3119B-ms98-a,47,B,223.322125,234.87,11.547875,but you know i don't i don't have any kids yet and that's what they kept stressing in a lot of the brochures is if your kids are going to you know be able to survive at all without having mounds of trash around them_1 everybody's got to start doing this,1,0
sw3119B-ms98-a,60,B,286.825625,295.53,8.704375,tell them to put their trash in this one and the paper that can be recycled in that one and hopefully  they'll go along with it ,1,0
sw3119B-ms98-a,77,B,364.1005,370.24,6.1395,but i mean they made a big deal to let everybody know that whole brochure was recycled and can be recycled again,1,0
sw3120A-ms98-a,27,A,65.859875,68.839625,2.97975,and your daughter is going to be a sophomore,1,0
sw3120A-ms98-a,48,A,188.79125,192.829125,4.037875,i and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing and,1,0
sw3120A-ms98-a,61,A,229.3395,237.020875,7.681375,our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M he's but he thinks he wants to be a writer and i don't think that,1,0
sw3120A-ms98-a,65,A,242.21325,248.419,6.20575,his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand,1,0
sw3120B-ms98-a,21,B,68.150375,73.185625,5.03525,that's correct i have two daughters but my oldest will be will be a sophomore,2,0
sw3120B-ms98-a,64,B,346.37325,349.76475,3.3915,what what does he hopes to be a writer,1,0
sw3120B-ms98-a,69,B,370.80125,378.410875,7.609625,what she talks about a lot is theater which i think is okay Bethany let's be real  um,1,0
sw3121A-ms98-a,25,A,80.73775,90.24225,9.5045,yeah that there's less visiting done i think on a whole than there used to be used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or not you went visiting ,2,0
sw3121A-ms98-a,58,A,173.84075,182.1535,8.31275,well that could be part of it i don't know for sure what it is i know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance so,1,0
sw3121A-ms98-a,69,A,209.463,212.798625,3.335625,well apparently there must be work available,1,0
sw3121A-ms98-a,109,A,356.6125,364.273625,7.661125,uh-huh now i'm going to babysit my granddaughter she's just eight weeks old so this will be new for me ,1,0
sw3121B-ms98-a,8,B,36.48375,40.377375,3.893625,there's still a lot to be  you know to be accomplished but,2,0
sw3121B-ms98-a,45,B,287.116125,293.6885,6.572375,be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up,2,0
sw3121B-ms98-a,53,B,348.819625,357.774125,8.9545,they are the first generation that basically grew up with day care and so you know it remained to be seen exactly what that what that does,1,0
sw3121B-ms98-a,64,B,397.7095,402.9325,5.223,i'm driving tomorr- i'm i'm driving home tomorrow so to go be there for the Fourth of July,1,0
sw3122A-ms98-a,30,A,118.026625,124.1385,6.111875,so i don't have to worry about going out there and like for example i'm going on this two week vacation he'll be fine,1,0
sw3122A-ms98-a,65,A,261.184375,265.2015,4.017125,and they can be very nice too aft- after they've been trained,1,0
sw3122B-ms98-a,6,B,20.942875,30.97125,10.028375,and the cat was um gray and white in particular had to be gray and white so all the Bounces have been gray and white we also have a rabbit,1,0
sw3122B-ms98-a,71,B,259.11675,262.327375,3.210625,yeah i guess it would have to be and we,1,0
sw3123A-ms98-a,24,A,169.509625,180.131875,10.62225,if it could possibly be standardized a little bit that it would be much easier to to gauge you know how uh a particular group of students was doing,2,0
sw3123A-ms98-a,27,A,203.677875,206.367875,2.69,that could be causing a problem,1,0
sw3123A-ms98-a,74,A,412.049875,414.7765,2.726625,well now what is Shepton going to be,1,0
sw3123B-ms98-a,20,B,101.87775,105.896,4.01825,and that seems to be the primary complaint uh,1,0
sw3123B-ms98-a,41,B,226.590125,238.438125,11.848,is a uh was just elected to go or selected whatever i i think you have to apply and be accepted to these magnet schools but she's interested in the arts and in in particular in dance,1,0
sw3123B-ms98-a,43,B,245.997625,253.2085,7.210875,and uh she will be attending i think Skyline Arts Magnet uh or arts and,1,0
sw3123B-ms98-a,50,B,282.46525,286.38275,3.9175,now i would think that would would be a good point as well,1,0
sw3124A-ms98-a,64,A,357.7695,366.491125,8.721625,oh oh right right  if only it would make nice snow here in Texas we'd be okay at Christmas time,1,0
sw3124A-ms98-a,75,A,418.87,432.66175,13.79175,the hill on the sleds when it's icy i mean they just go down the ice  yeah if it's cold we say okay out you go i think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there,1,0
sw3124B-ms98-a,22,B,111.116375,120.992875,9.8765,you know so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather it might rain on your little parade,1,0
sw3124B-ms98-a,45,B,224.917875,235.47375,10.555875,uh in the winter time the lakes froze over you could still kind of go sledding and such out there but i thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes there's lots of really small ones out there,1,0
sw3124B-ms98-a,70,B,371.366125,381.7475,10.381375,there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December be- couple days before Christmas it lasted only a few hours like by noon it was gone,1,0
sw3125A-ms98-a,18,A,81.249875,83.45625,2.206375,i'll be darned,1,0
sw3125A-ms98-a,68,A,336.49375,351.485,14.99125,yes absolutely and and uh if the team you know starts off good this year i think that uh they will be a a drawing card and perhaps they can uh uh return to their former glory days ,1,0
sw3125B-ms98-a,21,B,104.955375,110.708125,5.75275,getting hurt i don't think this one has any a record like that he seems to be more of a,1,0
sw3125B-ms98-a,75,B,330.481625,337.96075,7.479125,i'm hoping that they'll be successful and they'll have a lot more sellouts and fewer blackouts this year,1,0
sw3126A-ms98-a,23,A,88.2775,92.73075,4.45325,oh my gosh that's supposed to be the greatest time to fish,1,0
sw3126A-ms98-a,71,A,309.247,318.37025,9.12325,and it was so funny because i mean they'd just be hanging over the side of the boat mom i think i got a fish i think i got a fish oh it was hysterical but,1,0
sw3126B-ms98-a,40,B,135.336125,137.19275,1.856625,i'll be,1,0
sw3127A-ms98-a,18,A,61.340375,72.271625,10.93125,yeah  he's learning from the big brothers huh  that's neat though and sometimes those that see their older brothers do it turn out to be pretty good because they pick up skills,1,0
sw3127A-ms98-a,34,A,117.985375,125.786,7.800625,right right i- well that's seems to be a a pretty current trend i i work in the schools and i see a lot of kids that,1,0
sw3127A-ms98-a,62,A,311.859375,325.244125,13.38475,and uh but i had an understanding with the principal that under no circumstances was i to be treated any differently i don't want i said i don't want teachers coming to me in the middle of the day when they couldn't get to anybody else's mother in the middle of the day,1,0
sw3127A-ms98-a,63,A,325.244125,329.737,4.492875,that that it would be handled the same way they h- dealt with other p- other kids,1,0
sw3127A-ms98-a,65,A,335.253875,346.066375,10.8125,every time some little thing goes wrong to run and pretty soon all you're hearing is negative things so it you know and those things need to be dealt with in the classroom by the teacher and not tattled necessarily,1,0
sw3127A-ms98-a,75,A,386.6345,392.69725,6.06275,uh for the parents who cannot be there to parent during the day their idea of parenting is,1,0
sw3127A-ms98-a,86,A,436.704375,450.676625,13.97225,time to to parent i- it's i don't i don't know what the answer is to it it's it's really sad i there may not be i but i- it beats being it beats being homeless  you know and,1,0
sw3127B-ms98-a,13,B,79.41225,81.524375,2.112125,i try to be as much as i can,1,0
sw3128A-ms98-a,63,A,227.792875,231.999,4.206125,i mean that's i didn't know if it had to be a casserole of sorts,1,0
sw3128B-ms98-a,49,B,167.38025,173.48225,6.102,would probably be very laid back we'd probably do ribs or chicken or,1,0
sw3128B-ms98-a,57,B,209.050375,214.69525,5.644875,well my life is kind of casual so my dinner parties would be also,1,0
sw3128B-ms98-a,61,B,230.689,232.422375,1.733375,it can be anything,1,0
sw3128B-ms98-a,62,B,232.422375,238.437875,6.0155,it can be anything i  i may just bring fresh fruit because i know everybody will eat that even though it's not,1,0
sw3129A-ms98-a,35,A,232.696375,235.4625,2.766125,i'll be ,1,0
sw3129A-ms98-a,49,A,377.79025,390.492625,12.702375,and the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would uh be driving along uh decelerating like coming to a stop sign but not yet stopped at the stop sign and the engine would just quit,1,0
sw3129A-ms98-a,56,A,440.992,450.43,9.438,for a a considerable period of time and now it seems to be we don- we're not experiencing the stalling but we're still experiencing a very uneven,1,0
sw3129B-ms98-a,8,B,47.968125,58.477,10.508875,so i'll be faced with having to return that product and uh and hoping that uh you know that they will accept it although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used,1,0
sw3129B-ms98-a,12,B,73.69025,82.6755,8.98525,and uh pretty much decided that that had to be the problem i talked to one mechanic about it and he suspected the switch also,1,0
sw3129B-ms98-a,13,B,82.6755,95.958,13.2825,uh but i've not you know i really don't know what the problem might be it it the other switch could be the main switch itself uh that turns the lights on or off which is on the dashboard,2,0
sw3129B-ms98-a,14,B,95.958,99.457125,3.499125,uh it might be tied into the equation somehow,1,0
sw3129B-ms98-a,30,B,189.296625,191.50825,2.211625,so it must be for a different year,1,0
sw3129B-ms98-a,38,B,241.236,252.727875,11.491875,so uh uh i may have to check with that person as it turns out that one that shop is near where i now work so i'll uh i should be able to take it in and check that part out,1,0
sw3130B-ms98-a,6,B,16.824625,28.632875,11.80825,really we have recently started uh a bin program here in Plano where uh used to be we we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up,1,0
sw3130B-ms98-a,62,B,338.63375,348.493875,9.860125,um because th- it'll be that much easier for us you know like i said now we have to take it over to to Wal-Mart it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked it up um ,2,0
sw3131A-ms98-a,3,A,25.821875,38.629125,12.80725,they live down in College Station where his parents do too and they put her in a home last year she appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to uh not be able to be in her apartment on her own,2,0
sw3131A-ms98-a,28,A,167.7065,182.017875,14.311375,um she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care uh then she got uh uh hip broken and then uh she wasn't as ambulatory so they were almost you know to the point of saying she can't be here anymore but,1,0
sw3131A-ms98-a,36,A,235.341875,240.5,5.158125,very antisocial maybe it takes a while for them to say okay well i'll be with other people but,1,0
sw3131A-ms98-a,37,A,240.5,244.996375,4.496375,yeah i don't understand that they they don't want to be with anybody else,1,0

sw3131A-ms98-a,56,A,381.766375,392.7955,11.029125,that's from the child's standpoint the child is going why don't you want to be close to me and your other family what does that house got attraction i never really thought of independence,1,0
sw3131A-ms98-a,70,A,435.294625,443.172375,7.87775,yeah my husband and i we have been thinking about his folks are in College Station and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the Dallas area and,1,0
sw3131B-ms98-a,2,B,0.986875,15.211125,14.22425,we're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and and making the decision on a family basis and probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process,1,0
sw3131B-ms98-a,50,B,243.718125,257.836,14.117875,i as i think i mentioned i was in the trust business and i've seen so many elderly people usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if if you're financially if if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money but,1,0
sw3131B-ms98-a,51,B,257.836,268.246625,10.410625,the the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the the retirement places where where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better,1,0
sw3131B-ms98-a,61,B,320.8335,333.154375,12.320875,you know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and and i've seen people really fight it that desperately needed to make the change,1,0
sw3131B-ms98-a,81,B,403.211625,413.190875,9.97925,she'll let something slip and we'll  say wait a minute and and that's it she just well i didn't want to bother you she can't accept that we want to be the care givers,1,0
sw3132A-ms98-a,71,A,314.14,316.746125,2.606125,would be my guess so,1,0
sw3132B-ms98-a,24,B,138.84125,143.07425,4.233,i think it could be i do a little bit of gardening,1,0
sw3133A-ms98-a,43,A,171.3605,178.140125,6.779625,a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest so i know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area,1,0
sw3133A-ms98-a,49,A,205.964375,217.794375,11.83,well and maybe um maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back um if we've lost some of that and it it seems in the last decade or two um,1,0
sw3134A-ms98-a,2,A,0.612375,7.619625,7.00725,okay i guess we're supposed to discuss the uh school system that shouldn't be too much trouble for the two of us right,1,0
sw3134A-ms98-a,25,A,106.29025,115.577,9.28675,but there still can be an attitude of you know this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now but but that the most important thing is still,1,0
sw3134A-ms98-a,104,A,399.867125,409.516625,9.6495,to be in situations and schools where we don't see that my folks talk about it a lot in Illinois my mother is was a teacher for years and years and um ,1,0
sw3134B-ms98-a,15,B,100.818625,109.624875,8.80625,and it may be a survival thing for the family which you can understand so um right,1,0
sw3134B-ms98-a,29,B,203.864,218.662,14.798,true i think they there has to be at least a counselor and we just recently had a counselor at elementary we didn't even have counselors in elementary we have always though had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids and,1,0
sw3134B-ms98-a,34,B,245.35175,257.03525,11.6835,i hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them on and occasionally that happens,1,0
sw3134B-ms98-a,37,B,272.609,276.93525,4.32625,than what are we going to do with them what's going to happen to them are they going to be,1,0
sw3134B-ms98-a,38,B,276.93525,287.80175,10.8665,able to uh work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them that's no good,1,0
sw3134B-ms98-a,44,B,336.690875,345.575625,8.88475,well i think uh one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world,2,0
sw3135A-ms98-a,6,A,27.92125,37.717625,9.796375,right off of Walnut Hill and Preston and it was a wonderful environment i i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place,1,0
sw3135A-ms98-a,29,A,150.0325,156.248125,6.215625,you know i willingly did it but i thought this makes me angry this is something that ought to be in the schools,1,0
sw3135A-ms98-a,31,A,160.678875,174.332875,13.654,well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes,1,0
sw3135A-ms98-a,50,A,280.876875,284.2275,3.350625,yeah oh that would be hard,1,0
sw3135A-ms98-a,59,A,352.68525,363.867125,11.181875,but i  i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work two income families i think are here to stay,1,0
sw3135A-ms98-a,67,A,389.048625,397.407625,8.359,w- they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces,2,0
sw3136A-ms98-a,13,A,60.0165,72.697375,12.680875,that's nice oh i love blackberries and we w- uh when i was smaller we my family lived in Tennessee and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick my brother and i ,1,0
sw3136A-ms98-a,23,A,159.009875,172.99725,13.987375,that seems to be helping and he put it on the front yard to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard but we've got a Great Dane in the back and she has eaten everything i have put out there she's eaten my crepe myrtle trees,1,0
sw3136A-ms98-a,70,A,422.99525,431.979,8.98375,yeah well mine's getting there he helps he does half and i do half so pretty soon though by next year he should be able to do it all by himself,1,0
sw3136A-ms98-a,73,A,437.9875,446.650875,8.663375,oh sure i'll be more then glad to pay him if he'd just go out there and do it and and do it to where i don't have to go back out and redo it that that's my only thing with him,1,0
sw3136B-ms98-a,5,B,33.25875,45.4565,12.19775,um-hum yeah and so they've been really good and the ki- i had to  the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries,1,0
sw3136B-ms98-a,73,B,384.48075,396.454875,11.974125,everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them or and so even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few months it would all be back and,1,0
sw3137A-ms98-a,89,A,395.157375,401.935375,6.778,i'll be and my sister has tried that with both hamsters gerbils and s- birds,1,0
sw3137A-ms98-a,103,A,442.64325,448.644375,6.001125,well i would like to we shall see i want it to be a you know indoor outdoor animal next time,1,0
sw3137B-ms98-a,60,B,277.7565,288.83275,11.07625,so we thought okay what's wrong with this dog who would give up a two year old Golden Retriever you know that's a nice dog something's got to be wrong with this dog,1,0
sw3137B-ms98-a,78,B,387.206125,395.823625,8.6175,but the cat doesn't seem to be too bothered with them it's it's the dog that just sits there for hour after hour and watches these hamsters it's it's funny,1,0
sw3137B-ms98-a,91,B,431.863,440.1135,8.2505,but he doesn't seem to be bothered with them you know he's real content you know chasing flies and birds outside so you know he's he's not too bad,1,0
sw3138A-ms98-a,14,A,29.68525,35.74675,6.0615,oh yeah well i'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys too so,1,0
sw3138B-ms98-a,89,B,296.504375,301.982875,5.4785,i bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really kind of gives it a tang that would be good,1,0
sw3138B-ms98-a,95,B,333.492,345.32875,11.83675,yeah and it's only it used to be like a hun- hundred calories per tablespoon and now it's like twelve oh i just think that's the best thing to have happened i'm just so excited about that,1,0
sw3138B-ms98-a,119,B,424.226375,438.494875,14.2685,oh he just left for the doctor again and it's it's kind of back up um so he needs to be careful again so we've really been talking about the foods you know for him to to be sure to eat yeah and uh,2,0
sw3140A-ms98-a,50,A,267.47825,279.193125,11.714875,there's they might be saving money i mean even if they had to pay more now i mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work even though it's higher productivity is short-term,1,0
sw3141A-ms98-a,22,A,98.852625,102.78,3.927375,but see that's what would be hard for us since we're not there a lot,1,0
sw3141A-ms98-a,27,A,110.364625,119.042,8.677375,i think Jay would go bananas over that though  he likes for our house to be as secure as possible ,1,0
sw3141A-ms98-a,33,A,132.007375,142.2885,10.281125,that can be so therapeutic though when when i really want to just crawl into a shell i think uh wouldn't it be nice just to lay on the bed and pet the cat ,2,0
sw3141A-ms98-a,51,A,232.059125,244.00225,11.943125,i remember my first camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of them_1 that were going to be award winning type  photos they've always been a part of my life,1,0
sw3141A-ms98-a,73,A,349.905,355.81275,5.90775,uh we we say that's going to be the end but i think when it really comes to it we'll want another pet ,1,0
sw3141B-ms98-a,87,B,389.005375,402.819375,13.814,that's right we just we just were on vacation and uh it was you know it was expensive plus i think you know for Pumpkin he didn't you know he didn't like it we were gone two weeks and that was hard on him to be boarded for two weeks and,1,0
sw3142A-ms98-a,87,A,368.001875,371.662375,3.6605,you know we've never been there and that's supposed to be wonderful,1,0
sw3142A-ms98-a,98,A,411.499,416.692625,5.193625,uh God that's that's supposed to be a wonderful place w- uh uh uh here in Plano,1,0
sw3142B-ms98-a,12,B,52.329875,65.991625,13.66175,it just you know it just varies we do a mix sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was just to you know have a moment of peace and quiet -out little ones at the table,1,0
sw3142B-ms98-a,80,B,393.34375,404.964,11.62025,and then i guess it must be seasonal and we've been back oh i guess it's in the winter season well they've never had it when we've been back so but uh well you ought to try that it's it's it's very good,1,0
sw3143A-ms98-a,8,A,54.99075,66.982,11.99125,be an innocent bystander just to be in that location and i thought how sad it was that just to be in a wrong location at the wrong time and and a lot of kids you know are caught that way,3,0
sw3143A-ms98-a,19,A,107.033,121.77275,14.73975,but in in on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full we can't at least in this area you know they don't have any room to put anybody so a lot of people just get out you know back on the streets because there's no they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have,1,0
sw3143A-ms98-a,24,A,141.469875,144.986375,3.5165,that's true maybe the punishment should be more severe,1,0
sw3143A-ms98-a,32,A,178.7315,192.263875,13.532375,uh well i don't know i was watching on a movie on TV i don't know how true those can be but you know they one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them you know you won't have a record because you're under eighteen to steal cars and everything,1,0
sw3143A-ms98-a,33,A,192.263875,201.248125,8.98425,so i guess if they had more of a deterrent if they had more severe punishments it might be but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial,1,0
sw3143A-ms98-a,48,A,281.79675,291.172875,9.376125,it's true and the weapons my God the weapons that people have are some people are mo- seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military i don't know where they get them,1,0
sw3143A-ms98-a,55,A,302.728125,316.400875,13.67275,it's hard to even i can't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be especially if you're an inner city you know you can't really feel like you're putting much of a dent in what's going on and you're putting your life on your on the line everyday,1,0
sw3143A-ms98-a,59,A,330.745625,336.4795,5.733875,yeah i just read an article yesterday um where this what used to be a nice town in this area,1,0
sw3143A-ms98-a,61,A,338.699375,353.500875,14.8015,Massachusetts is broke right now and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy and they had to cut twenty guys from their forces and the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldn't be patrolled as well,1,0
sw3143B-ms98-a,13,B,82.18325,85.499,3.31575,that's really sad i've so you know it must be frus-,1,0
sw3143B-ms98-a,15,B,89.837,91.2895,1.4525,be so scary,1,0
sw3143B-ms98-a,21,B,120.747875,129.4725,8.724625,yeah they do that here too but i say you know they commit crimes let them be overcrowded  you know let them suffer a little bit,1,0
sw3143B-ms98-a,23,B,134.259875,141.290625,7.03075,yeah i think so i think if they knew it was going to be really horrible wherever they were going maybe they'd think twice about doing it,1,0
sw3143B-ms98-a,26,B,153.981,163.25175,9.27075,people they i don't know if that's just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything but that worries me i wonder what the next generation will be like,1,0
sw3143B-ms98-a,45,B,272.99025,281.748625,8.758375,yeah seemed like like in the fifties when gangs were big it was just to be part of the gang but now they're so much into selling drugs and weapons and all that,1,0
sw3143B-ms98-a,48,B,290.807875,299.983375,9.1755,really yeah those machine guns and all that yeah that's scary it's a wonder there's anybody who's willing to be a policeman anymore,1,0
sw3143B-ms98-a,50,B,315.47975,327.964,12.48425,yeah Dallas they were saying in Dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen but they keep losing them all the time and that uh you know eventually we're going to be way short on the number we need because,1,0
sw3144A-ms98-a,16,A,71.006375,77.498375,6.492,oh my well let me see was it well we went to see One Hundred And One Dalmatians last weekend and that may be,1,0
sw3144A-ms98-a,48,A,276.045625,279.825625,3.78,he says yeah you'll be out there waterskiing i can just see it now,1,0
sw3144B-ms98-a,29,B,177.05875,183.0755,6.01675,uh if you have a chance to rent it at least or it should be out on TV i would think,1,0
sw3146A-ms98-a,24,A,98.482375,109.783875,11.3015,it's wonderful the only thing is you have to wait you have you have to expect to wait at least an hour so you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in and,1,0
sw3146A-ms98-a,53,A,237.557625,248.438375,10.88075,i keep hearing about it i keep hearing the advertisements of it and and they keep saying you know oh it's wonderful it's wonderful i have not been over there and i was thinking you know it's supposed to be a family place,1,0
sw3146A-ms98-a,80,A,400.29775,404.10925,3.8115,i guess there's so much competition that they really have to be good,1,0
sw3146A-ms98-a,84,A,423.7845,431.745375,7.960875, and you know in order to survive in this area i think they have to be good because the ones that aren't so good don't just don't make it,1,0
sw3146B-ms98-a,87,B,412.957125,425.3065,12.349375,in a way it's like a little mini vacation i guess and uh it is it's a whole experience of course you want the food to be good but the atmosphere and service i think are important uh too,1,0
sw3147A-ms98-a,62,A,292.531,295.445625,2.914625,yeah it needs to be a place they want to go,1,0
sw3147A-ms98-a,63,A,295.445625,306.029625,10.584,uh if they're going to be successful if they think Mom and Dad picked it or they're going there because that's where Mom and Dad went and that's what they want them to do uh that's the wrong reason for picking a place,1,0
sw3147A-ms98-a,72,A,361.497375,363.200375,1.703,well that could be,1,0
sw3147A-ms98-a,87,A,426.2145,435.3845,9.17,that's right i mean it would be nice if you could but you you can be successful without necessarily having a uh a degree from an Eastern school,2,0
sw3147B-ms98-a,47,B,196.3415,202.62525,6.28375,and then it kind of got to be a combination of what she thought she wanted to do and uh,1,0
sw3147B-ms98-a,79,B,340.773625,351.89975,11.126125,yeah well it seems uh i don't know of a whole bunch of kids who uh really do what their father did there's some i think doctors may be a place where and i don't know quite why,1,0
sw3148A-ms98-a,14,A,41.446375,52.683625,11.23725,well i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that and unfortunately i think there are a lot of areas that are that that bad particularly in the areas where there are industries uh,1,0
sw3148A-ms98-a,31,A,206.527125,221.05175,14.524625,is not bomb quality and we're so strict with all our controls in the United States the chances of of an accident are slight and it doesn't pollute the air at all it's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant,2,0
sw3148A-ms98-a,37,A,259.037625,269.5625,10.524875,so i don't know what the answer is the best answer of course would be solar or uh  fusion or something clean  well we've got a problem on the line don't we,1,0
sw3148A-ms98-a,41,A,276.678875,280.13725,3.458375,solar of course would be the clean cleanest ,1,0
sw3148A-ms98-a,53,A,345.6965,349.154,3.4575,you know con- be able to control it i don't know how long that'll take but,1,0
sw3148A-ms98-a,66,A,386.307625,389.9815,3.673875,i like to be optimistic i don't like to be  about these things,2,0
sw3148B-ms98-a,40,B,291.496875,299.8785,8.381625,oh  i don't know what to  usually it's the other phone i have trouble with it must just be on the line can you hear me,1,0
sw3148B-ms98-a,43,B,304.099375,318.787,14.687625,i i don't know what the problem is but uh when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy and we have enough clouds that uh ,1,0
sw3148B-ms98-a,44,B,318.787,332.377375,13.590375,there are other areas that would be better suited that surprised me because i think we have a tremendous amount of um sunny days and and it yes it can be used and it can help but uh that was a problem that they were still,2,0
sw3149A-ms98-a,3,A,2.2745,15.773125,13.498625,all right well i guess you know i- i wasn't expecting that question about AIDS so i haven't thought too much about it but i guess i think that we should have more research um i'm just concerned that it's just going to be such a major health problem,1,0
sw3149A-ms98-a,4,A,15.773125,21.9895,6.216375,and if we you know and if it's not i say it would seem to me the sooner we take care of it the better off we're going to be,1,0
sw3149A-ms98-a,7,A,34.953875,41.41625,6.462375,and it's just so scary that there's just not much that can be done at this point so i guess,1,0
sw3149A-ms98-a,18,A,71.67425,81.436125,9.761875,well i think so too and so i guess i would you know personally i would be really in favor of that now i have had um i have two friends who've died of it,1,0
sw3149A-ms98-a,31,A,153.834,161.80675,7.97275,uh you know i- i would hate to be in a position where i would need a transfusion or my children i think it would be a real scary thing,2,0
sw3149A-ms98-a,40,A,191.272875,201.3225,10.049625,well i i don't know i mean i just but then i think well uh yeah i guess that basically i do think we just need more research because_1 that's going to sort of be the our only answer,1,0
sw3149A-ms98-a,70,A,334.294875,335.84875,1.553875,would be a terrible,1,0
sw3149A-ms98-a,71,A,335.84875,338.191625,2.342875,that would be a terrible thing,1,0
sw3149B-ms98-a,31,B,120.71475,125.1545,4.43975,yeah and you know well with the time factor it could be up to ten years,1,0
sw3150A-ms98-a,32,A,230.235125,239.73925,9.504125,and i guess they said you know sh- do you think it should be restricted i guess if it were if if because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment i guess violent crimes would be the,2,0
sw3150A-ms98-a,44,A,319.37925,331.888375,12.509125,and it really isn't for some people tha- who have been there uh for over and over and over it really isn't uh as ba- i mean there it's not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect,1,0
sw3150A-ms98-a,48,A,363.2875,366.304875,3.017375,right and what they're going to be doing when they get ,1,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,10,B,53.706375,56.058125,2.35175,yeah it would never be equal,1,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,19,B,80.923,89.2395,8.3165,you know he's never going to be to me a functioning part of society he's already been either paroled or whatever for child molestation,1,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,31,B,135.69,145.500875,9.810875,i guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever i don't i mean i don't know but uh you know,1,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,32,B,145.500875,150.10675,4.605875,that that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be,2,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,42,B,187.6385,192.980625,5.342125,right exactly you know and nobody wants that you know know everybody would be just be scared to death,2,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,44,B,204.667125,211.2335,6.566375,you know you just think you know where's the justice here i mean you know they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving,1,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,58,B,274.270625,281.517375,7.24675,i- i really would have a hard time especially if i was on a jury not wanting him to you know be executed yeah,1,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,61,B,285.005125,297.07625,12.071125,r- right and well i have a hu- i have a hunch that you know the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway either i mean you know they i don't know from from what i hear about jail life is not a- any way to live but uh,1,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,75,B,341.173125,347.379375,6.20625,yeah well you know e- especially like repeat offenders it it just appalls me that they can be out,1,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,76,B,347.379375,352.764875,5.3855,you know they even get a a ten year sentence and be out in in two or three or four years,1,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,78,B,357.397,364.39575,6.99875,i think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're you know going to be committing any more violent acts or not,1,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,85,B,405.125625,412.2465,7.120875,  well luckily it was for me because_1 they won't uh th- they coordinate the times so it can only be one or the other,1,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,89,B,424.17,427.47775,3.30775,i think that it that it might not be such a bad thing,1,0
sw3150B-ms98-a,90,B,427.47775,439.0585,11.58075,because i don't know that anybody w- in i don't know that anybody would feel good you know like if you let someone like that loose in your community you know i i i'm su- you'd have to be scared to death,1,0
sw3151A-ms98-a,3,A,7.207125,11.314125,4.107,basically i think it would be a good idea myself,1,0
sw3151A-ms98-a,5,A,13.4385,26.286375,12.847875,i think if somebody's not on drugs they have no reason you know to be afraid of it uh i do think that there has to be some controls uh like i don't think one test positive should,2,0
sw3151A-ms98-a,6,A,26.286375,29.279375,2.993,uh be uh,1,0
sw3151A-ms98-a,17,A,75.345375,82.52575,7.180375,i i think there definitely needs to be some control to it i guess it is possible to have a false,1,0
sw3151A-ms98-a,54,A,224.657625,230.42625,5.768625,that person plus anybody in danger should should b- know about it and be aware of it,1,0
sw3151A-ms98-a,58,A,236.725375,247.652125,10.92675,i guess the the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that that uh an invasion of privacy of course that's not  to be what we're talking about today i guess so,1,0
sw3151A-ms98-a,92,A,356.33175,358.573875,2.242125,oh i'll be darn,1,0
sw3151B-ms98-a,8,B,33.282375,45.093375,11.811,yeah it- it's refreshing to hear somebody that has a similar opinion as mine i mean all these people that are against it that may the- yeah they may not even be on drugs yet they they call it an invasion of privacy,1,0
sw3151B-ms98-a,20,B,84.07175,97.4945,13.42275,yeah no i i i agree that you know you there there needs to be a a well thought out sane approach to how to administer that program just because you know you y- something can get mixed up in the mail or ,1,0
sw3152A-ms98-a,4,A,13.706625,20.630375,6.92375,those are my that's my favorite type uh probably the favorite instrument would be uh the violin,1,0
sw3152B-ms98-a,6,B,28.962375,31.963125,3.00075,i guess if i had to pick it would be l-,1,0
sw3152B-ms98-a,101,B,447.021375,449.625125,2.60375,i don't know if any of mine will be interested in it or,1,0
sw3153B-ms98-a,22,B,157.305375,170.693375,13.388,i got to slap in the face as far as the medical profession was concerned in the United States uh now the doctor that i worked for was good but there was another one in our complex that uh she didn't feel should even be practicing medicine    well why don't they,1,0
sw3153B-ms98-a,30,B,212.089375,224.44425,12.354875,and i i fear that the doctors are going to not be as you know right now they're in a lot of fierce competition  so they they keep up to date you know at least most of them the good ones,1,0
sw3153B-ms98-a,35,B,252.284,265.0335,12.7495,same thing i mean these doctors didn't want to be here okay they were  fulfilling their military obligations and you know they uh of course i guess if you a doctor gets into the field you know they uh,1,0
sw3153B-ms98-a,37,B,269.791,279.964,10.173,uh through people that i know that have HMO's that most of the doctors that they see there may be one or two good ones and the rest of them are either foreign speaking,1,0
sw3153B-ms98-a,40,B,296.815625,307.720125,10.9045,you know so i just it just this is a bad subject for me to be on  only because i've had some real bad experiences and i've known some people that have uh,1,0
sw3153B-ms98-a,47,B,331.082,341.373875,10.291875,i don't know some ache or pain or just how they you know reply um uh if they're going to be good or not the doctor that will sit down and talk to you and that will you know do things like that uh ,1,0
sw3153B-ms98-a,54,B,371.688375,384.5115,12.823125,okay  i mean  you could  you could really be in serious  if you wait to see one of the ones that you feel are better if uh uh you know if we went to that and that was all there was,1,0
sw3153B-ms98-a,57,B,388.250125,395.686625,7.4365,oh  they don't  it would it would still be like it is now um the ones in your area,1,0
sw3153B-ms98-a,58,B,395.686625,404.593,8.906375,you know and that would be closest to where you live uh and you know those are the ones that you would see i mean i would presume um,1,0
sw3153B-ms98-a,70,B,439.071,447.574375,8.503375,that's right and uh i mean you know that could potentially be um,1,0
sw3154A-ms98-a,6,A,32.037,43.90075,11.86375,well maybe they don't i i know that was supposed to be in May and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were,1,0
sw3154A-ms98-a,9,A,52.757125,61.727625,8.9705,that's going to be interesting because it's uh  we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is ,1,0
sw3154A-ms98-a,12,A,73.777625,86.79575,13.018125,uh it'll be interesting to see how well that works and i am i'm glad the community is doing it uh it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people,2,0
sw3154A-ms98-a,32,A,155.54275,167.832875,12.290125,childhood and i'd say you know  they were doing things then that we should be doing now and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're we're uh kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this,1,0
sw3154A-ms98-a,66,A,341.742125,350.570625,8.8285,well it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because like on the uh grass i'm i know your husband uh,1,0
sw3154B-ms98-a,25,B,171.793375,182.270125,10.47675,right right it would be nice it would be nice to see it take a good turn here it seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away so i hope that this time it it it stays i mean it's just,2,0
sw3154B-ms98-a,42,B,280.55725,287.3945,6.83725,they were glass they were the glass uh well let's see they'd be i don't know maybe ten ounce or,1,0
sw3155A-ms98-a,73,A,281.80325,284.488875,2.685625,oh it's supposed to be a real scary one,1,0
sw3155B-ms98-a,20,B,103.292,109.966875,6.674875,supposed to be his uh his debut in comedy  which was an interesting movie but not very funny,1,0
sw3155B-ms98-a,41,B,209.107625,216.012375,6.90475,and uh someone said that was a lot of fun to go do you can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie i thought that might be kind of fun to do,1,0
sw3156A-ms98-a,1,A,0,8.198375,8.198375,  it seems to be a a topic that's gonna probably take about a generation to uh catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two,1,0
sw3156A-ms98-a,2,A,8.198375,16.948125,8.74975,and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up but it does seem to be a lot of habits to break,1,0
sw3156A-ms98-a,23,A,164.913,168.890875,3.977875,um the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor so,1,0
sw3156A-ms98-a,36,A,210.209375,222.462,12.252625,they don't do that we live next to a set of railroad tracks and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash you know break them_1 but,1,0
sw3156A-ms98-a,37,A,222.462,232.285125,9.823125,uh they weren't that successful so there were a lot of bottles to be returned and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day ,1,0
sw3156B-ms98-a,9,B,109.005375,115.525625,6.52025, but i it it should be starting i would stay probably in the next month if if everything goes that,1,0
sw3156B-ms98-a,21,B,194.810375,206.620125,11.80975,they didn't even have cans they had bottles and you'd return them to the the grocery store and you'd get your money back and that that was all well and good and they don't seem to still be doing that if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass but ,1,0
sw3156B-ms98-a,29,B,241.95325,251.429625,9.476375,right they're the the nickels the dimes or what     be quarter and fifty cent pieces in these days that they would get they the kids just don't seem to,1,0
sw3157A-ms98-a,35,A,74.28025,80.76,6.47975,because_1 we might be liberated but now we all have to work  support  and,1,0
sw3157B-ms98-a,50,B,184.562,188.613,4.051,and i don't know i think there may even be a turnabout,1,0
sw3158A-ms98-a,9,A,48.492375,52.2285,3.736125,yeah that might be it that might and yet there's uh,1,0
sw3158B-ms98-a,12,B,44.697875,50.176875,5.479,well it just reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging i think,1,0
sw3158B-ms98-a,61,B,235.0055,242.96375,7.95825,well and i'm at the age where  or trifocals would be necessary and so i find myself putting glasses on to,1,0
sw3159B-ms98-a,42,B,178.093125,184.89075,6.797625, i can see that it will be a very long time probably before i subscribe to any magazines at home,1,0
sw3160A-ms98-a,33,A,134.592375,140.42225,5.829875,is he middle field or left field he's not left field he must be center field,1,0
sw3160B-ms98-a,15,B,73.75875,82.34925,8.5905,yeah who's who's who he used to be on the Mets a long time ago but who's who's who else is like Texas's big players that that uh,1,0
sw3160B-ms98-a,17,B,90.272375,93.415875,3.1435,right Ru- right he's supposed to be good,1,0
sw3160B-ms98-a,43,B,259.227375,264.444125,5.21675, okay well it's nice talking to you and uh be good thank you,1,0
sw3161A-ms98-a,5,A,30.861,44.4195,13.5585,as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer uh there's some uh take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more peo- mean more people than AIDS,1,0
sw3161A-ms98-a,14,A,91.613,100.461625,8.848625, well i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then i go- i got to thinking,1,0
sw3161A-ms98-a,15,A,100.461625,111.82825,11.366625,the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood an- antigen uh  antibody test for the antigen in the blood,1,0
sw3161A-ms98-a,17,A,116.309875,124.349125,8.03925,so it's not really cure f- yeah it's not uh not that heavily funded either and that seems to be one of the the major,1,0
sw3161A-ms98-a,18,A,124.349125,134.200875,9.85175,uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer so i don't know i i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it,1,0
sw3161B-ms98-a,14,B,168.9375,181.128375,12.190875,you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because_1 they're all so serious you know i mean it's not so serious i guess until it affects your family and then all the sudden it's the most important thing,1,0
sw3161B-ms98-a,18,B,202.144125,209.172,7.027875,many of those things um if they're not able to to be insured then the country's gonna pay for it one way or the other,1,0
sw3162A-ms98-a,7,A,25.07425,33.65675,8.5825,uh things in regards to cases like the Dahmer case in Milwaukee and stuff so it's it may be an idea to think about,1,0
sw3162A-ms98-a,51,A,254.072125,265.514875,11.44275,and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay i know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work or at lea- give them the time off,1,0
sw3162B-ms98-a,5,B,48.64225,58.550125,9.907875,right that a that a a a a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not not de- and and uh,1,0
sw3162B-ms98-a,6,B,58.550125,70.127125,11.577,not depend so much on the on the emotions of a particular case but be able to put it in overall perspective well i- i i certainly haven't thought much about this but ,1,0
sw3162B-ms98-a,18,B,121.8425,128.97,7.1275,yeah i- i certainly wouldn't be uh uh worried about that i guess in terms of the uh,1,0
sw3162B-ms98-a,19,B,128.97,138.640125,9.670125,uh you know ha- having a judge do it would seem to me to be more more fair and and uh unbiased uh ,1,0
sw3162B-ms98-a,21,B,145.693375,159.235125,13.54175, would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in in a trial system that that's just a such a tradition that it's a that it's got to be a unanimous jury that uh,2,0
sw3162B-ms98-a,37,B,279.5925,287.728375,8.135875,that that's necessarily required uh you know by law that it has to be paid um,1,0
sw3163B-ms98-a,9,B,49.89725,60.722375,10.825125,well i- i was thinking too in terms of of in terms of this you know the education is so different i think women are so much better educated now than they used to be and i think that makes a big impact on what women do,1,0
sw3163B-ms98-a,21,B,105.21225,117.5235,12.31125,yeah uh be- you know because really it isn't that long a period of time that you have to be home with children uh comparatively speaking if you look look through your whole look at your whole life um,2,0
sw3163B-ms98-a,30,B,163.864875,175.689625,11.82475,well and it will be fascinating to see within the next twenty to thirty years how that changes even more i think the impact will be felt more and more as as better educated women come into the work force,2,0
sw3164B-ms98-a,7,B,16.742375,24.8285,8.086125,well i just thought oh if i go and you know see this one i'm going to be disappointed but we thor- my husband and i went and we thoroughly enjoyed it,1,0
sw3164B-ms98-a,11,B,36.729625,39.582875,2.85325,air was supposed to be a promo,1,0

sw3173B-ms98-a,16,B,102.039125,106.8835,4.844375,uh pro- well probably probably that would be a good idea,1,0
sw3174B-ms98-a,7,B,52.446375,63.979125,11.53275,to alcohol but yet that can be carried to an extreme too so i think it's a good idea and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them_1 or get you off of them_1 because you're,2,0
sw3174B-ms98-a,8,B,63.979125,70.53,6.550875,i don't know that their job would be at risk because i think they may put them_1 into some sort of a,1,0
sw3174B-ms98-a,20,B,132.942125,142.139125,9.197,right and you never know they could just go off the deep end on on a on something uh that  whatever they're taking at the time and and it would be uh,1,0

sw3175B-ms98-a,20,B,151.993125,158.9125,6.919375,it i find it a little bit strange that their priorities would would be to spend this money here,1,0
sw3176A-ms98-a,6,A,23.513375,27.52225,4.008875,okay_1 so that would be like less control,1,0
sw3176A-ms98-a,33,A,110.275125,114.657875,4.38275,you know f- to help be protected  or whatever that night,1,0
sw3176A-ms98-a,34,A,114.657875,124.51375,9.855875,but i wouldn't want some crazy nut that you know gets mad at somebody else and says i'm gonna kill them to be able to get a gun that fast so it's like a double-edged  i guess,1,0
sw3176A-ms98-a,69,A,236.639,242.495375,5.856375,does that have to be like some heavy duty bullet to be able to do that or some real super gun or,2,0
sw3176B-ms98-a,5,B,13.36125,20.8715,7.51025,oh where would i be i would be somewhere around hm seven or eighth,2,0
sw3176B-ms98-a,22,B,98.922375,102.671,3.748625,uh-huh yeah i mean i could be five too,1,0
sw3176B-ms98-a,42,B,175.750125,187.659125,11.909,well you definitely need to you know have the uh respect for it and you can't just pick up a gun and expect to hit something you know you may be within let's say a f- foot range,1,0
sw3177A-ms98-a,15,A,65.72975,78.71975,12.99,right i usually use that as a preface to you know it's okay that the government used to do that or should do that as far as the good in- good incentive but since they're not doing it as well now i would be more in favor of ,1,0
sw3177A-ms98-a,16,A,78.71975,91.352,12.63225,uh not taxing anything directly in other just do straight purchases in other words if if you want to put a tax on what you buy then revenues can be generated that way ,1,0
sw3177A-ms98-a,25,A,115.347,118.5285,3.1815,so then you'd have a tendency to be taxing,1,0
sw3177A-ms98-a,55,A,258.249875,261.655,3.405125,they had some good ideas but they don't seem to be following them_1 anymore ,1,0
sw3177B-ms98-a,36,B,237.95,242.411125,4.461125,H&R Blocks would be out of  of a job but uh ,1,0
sw3179B-ms98-a,97,B,266.692375,270.769875,4.0775, yeah i guess no one will be watching that anymore ,1,0
sw3180A-ms98-a,24,A,158.38,164.642375,6.262375,and if you happen  to check your balance at the same time it would be two more dollars at least that's that's something huh,1,0
sw3180A-ms98-a,26,A,176.966625,191.5545,14.587875,card there and i happen to be less than a mile from one site and it's real convenient just to run up and get cash fact it's the closest automatic teller there is and it just happened to be the one that uh i'm with so that's nice to have those around,2,0
sw3180A-ms98-a,27,A,191.5545,202.078625,10.524125,and i only drive ten miles to work so it's kind of a uh one of those situations where they're they're all around me as it were i just happen to be in the right straight line between them_1,1,0
sw3181A-ms98-a,50,A,264.71725,270.3465,5.62925,so walking seems to be a good solution for me and it doesn't cost ,1,0
sw3181B-ms98-a,42,B,162.37975,176.114125,13.734375,i think that's really really good and and you know i- i think this after you've done it a certain amount of time it kind of does get to be a routine it's not like when i first started it,1,0
sw3181B-ms98-a,45,B,197.187625,207.208625,10.021,and when they don't i i really notice you know it how fun it can be when they come so um i like to have somebody come with me,1,0
sw3182A-ms98-a,39,A,258.543125,264.531375,5.98825,oh and it's so nice it must be so nice for you now that you're retired,1,0
sw3182B-ms98-a,46,B,197.74425,208.475,10.73075,if you ever start be sure and start with a large piece that you can i mean a large flat plate hm,1,0
sw3183A-ms98-a,52,A,238.64875,248.669375,10.020625,i would be very happy staying in Hawaii and becoming a beachcomber when i retire which isn't too far off which is something i might wanna consider but uh ,1,0
sw3183B-ms98-a,1,B,0,6.043375,6.043375, well we're gonna be talking about vacations i guess huh  where have you been recently,1,0
sw3183B-ms98-a,3,B,12.920625,22.90875,9.988125,Las Vegas well my dad goes there but i am not a betting m- i've been there one time and i'll be honest i did not enjoy it no no,1,0
sw3183B-ms98-a,8,B,55.204125,59.688,4.483875,uh that's gonna be in Paris France we're going there in July,1,0
sw3183B-ms98-a,15,B,87.37375,92.6235,5.24975,he had absolutely no desire to be around a boat he says man i get seasick i don't like it,1,0
sw3183B-ms98-a,26,B,166.272875,168.242125,1.96925,well if that be the c-,1,0
sw3184A-ms98-a,11,A,47.896625,60.78125,12.884625,and i think as far as if it if we're put it into standards of uh what other homes are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are um,1,0
sw3184A-ms98-a,35,A,152.24175,160.661875,8.420125,the TI um yes uh about three times a- so i'm fairly new to it but it seems to be going okay,1,0
sw3184B-ms98-a,4,B,7.22525,16.733,9.50775, i mean i i live in a nice area and i rent my home and uh we aren't sure we're gonna buy a house yet because we don't know if we're gonna be staying here,1,0
sw3185A-ms98-a,25,A,95.298625,99.356375,4.05775,and also the evenings are going to be getting uh darker sooner,1,0
sw3185A-ms98-a,27,A,101.475875,108.30675,6.830875,but i did a walk last night and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler,1,0
sw3185A-ms98-a,37,A,163.974625,177.001375,13.02675,yeah i think so too i know our grass needs mowing twice as often  it  but it seems like here i would like it to rain and then be over and then not rain for a while it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern that's all it does,1,0
sw3185A-ms98-a,38,A,177.001375,185.8025,8.801125,so uh but i- i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like i guess my my best would be probably,1,0
sw3185A-ms98-a,56,A,254.65125,262.141,7.48975,and milder fall everybody seems to be you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat because_1 they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're just,1,0
sw3185A-ms98-a,57,A,262.141,269.902875,7.761875, and then you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings and we'll it'll be too cold and they'll say well those are the ones that like the cold weather,1,0
sw3185B-ms98-a,23,B,81.878625,92.073,10.194375, well we have several children that are in sports and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on on and on,1,0
sw3185B-ms98-a,56,B,221.907375,235.543875,13.6365,that's  um i've i've thought about that too and um when we take our vacations we we do take them_1 in August sometimes so that we can be away from ,1,0
sw3187A-ms98-a,19,A,136.46225,149.3375,12.87525,yes and that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room,1,0
sw3187A-ms98-a,20,A,149.3375,161.68775,12.35025,so she didn't have to be transported back and forth so she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well it's not her favorite place to be in she'd much rather be here with me but,3,0
sw3187A-ms98-a,37,A,242.246375,255.22275,12.976375,well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them_1 make decisions it sure wouldn't have been Granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home but she's accepted it real well now,1,0
sw3187B-ms98-a,3,B,4.295375,15.128375,10.833,well i don't feel very good about it but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do we,1,0
sw3187B-ms98-a,15,B,90.90175,98.230125,7.328375,the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in,1,0
sw3187B-ms98-a,43,B,237.024375,241.53025,4.505875,he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home,1,0
sw3188A-ms98-a,47,A,217.02975,221.216375,4.186625,yeah that would be really time a a time saver,1,0
sw3188B-ms98-a,4,B,16.7505,29.9415,13.191,yeah and i've never painted anyth- i always thought it would be so you know you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something but i know i can do it  and the second one was i bought some toys at a um,1,0
sw3188B-ms98-a,27,B,173.922875,182.647125,8.72425,yeah i think though um we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work because_1 i don't know if i could you know i don't know i don't know must be difficult,1,0
sw3188B-ms98-a,39,B,242.70425,246.550125,3.845875,why just because you'd be afraid to do it or have you done it be-,2,0
sw3189A-ms98-a,6,A,25.8915,36.862625,10.971125,and so this was one and they um planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and and had you know things like that have to be planned like they had planned that,1,0
sw3189B-ms98-a,40,B,178.10225,185.45925,7.357,and uh i've always thought it would be so neat even if it were just my immediate family to have like a weekend type thing,1,0
sw3189B-ms98-a,41,B,185.45925,189.956625,4.497375,that would be so wonderful ,1,0
sw3190A-ms98-a,16,A,43.621375,48.996125,5.37475,so that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation now if you were a skier,1,0
sw3190A-ms98-a,36,A,117.90225,131.19225,13.29,we really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise so they said we could either cancel reschedule or take whatever was available so we took whatever was available,1,0
sw3190A-ms98-a,56,A,199.474875,202.759375,3.2845,right that would be,1,0
sw3190A-ms98-a,62,A,215.305375,224.147625,8.84225,oh with the Santa Claus on the cover yes i've already ordered from that one but we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year so,1,0
sw3190B-ms98-a,17,B,46.827625,60.831875,14.00425,well   well now i don't know now Colorado Springs is real accessible to like Breckenridge it's only a couple of hours away and uh so it's it might not be too bad if you wanted to go skiing somewhere else but you can't can't ski up there any more so ,1,0
sw3190B-ms98-a,57,B,233.07575,241.5475,8.47175,i talked to somebody from Wisconsin or something the other day yeah so i guess they get people from all over yeah driving for Thanksgiving that's going to be quite a drive for,1,0

sw3200A-ms98-a,44,A,184.562875,191.167,6.604125,we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was gonna be left and that was a real eye opener,1,0
sw3200B-ms98-a,15,B,85.449125,89.277125,3.828,well yeah i- i couldn't probably be bothered d- doing that,1,0

sw3204A-ms98-a,8,A,48.911625,58.1595,9.247875,which is not un- you know unrealistic um and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them_1 again or just answer another question,1,0
sw3204A-ms98-a,40,A,190.507125,202.6245,12.117375,our um some are good i have to say that but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children,1,0
sw3204A-ms98-a,47,A,237.82075,246.467375,8.646625,and uh and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker i don't  it's a very very hard decision i think,1,0
sw3204A-ms98-a,53,A,274.61,279.84775,5.23775,and that might be a partial solution or something but um,1,0

sw3206B-ms98-a,42,B,233.898625,242.845625,8.947,uh campaigning or whatever it might be um that kind of just kind of takes that load off you know you can just go ahead and get that taken care of and,1,0
sw3207A-ms98-a,6,A,44.662125,54.2245,9.562375,and it ta- it takes a lot of care like twenty four hours a day someone has to be we- like there's someone in my my fiance's family his grandmother too and they're,1,0
sw3207A-ms98-a,21,A,152.532375,159.497125,6.96475,family and that's really so bad for the guy who his whole life is different now and than he thought it would be but,1,0

sw3245A-ms98-a,68,A,248.227125,256.7205,8.493375,yeah so i would roll my windows down it was still a hundred degrees  and i would just be sweltering hot by the time i picked my daughter up and,1,0
sw3245A-ms98-a,72,A,271.750125,276.596375,4.84625,especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned which i don't have any ,1,0
sw3245B-ms98-a,26,B,104.183,114.236375,10.053375,and uh they have to my waist is kind of small compared to the hips so it has to be not the straight up and down Levi's kind ,1,0
sw3245B-ms98-a,55,B,223.04175,231.91275,8.871,married  even but uh offices they keep them so cold in the summer that you can't wear regular summer clothes and be comfortable,1,0

sw3246A-ms98-a,53,A,272.762625,277.7315,4.968875,and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of homework i would expect,1,0
sw3246A-ms98-a,56,A,289.451375,298.626,9.174625,yes you always hear how good now my son's at junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful but who knows what he's going to bring home so i don't,1,0
sw3246B-ms98-a,37,B,219.364125,230.337125,10.973,and it was wonderful so you know i'm  coming to to Plano thinking well gosh it's going to be really great it's ranked so much better  ,1,0
sw3247A-ms98-a,31,A,207.60525,221.774875,14.169625,in many cases uh arguably i- arguably is because of of uh of uh welfare state benefits though i tend to b- we tend to be skeptical,1,0
sw3248A-ms98-a,5,A,18.214625,25.440375,7.22575,lately their bank has been so full that they've been cutting us off after about_1 three to five minutes so it it won't be anything like the ,1,0
sw3248A-ms98-a,32,A,158.7685,169.011375,10.242875,maybe there's some areas that they could start a conversion like maybe at the gas pumps you know that would be one way maybe they need to do it in stages ,1,0
sw3248A-ms98-a,46,A,273.31425,285.657125,12.342875,well i don't know why the effort failed before but i have a feeling that it may have been businesses it would be costly for them to convert over um especially some of the,1,0

sw3249A-ms98-a,16,A,76.2285,81.7485,5.52,i think if it got much more than that i would start feeling like someone was gonna be left out,1,0
sw3249A-ms98-a,20,A,88.091625,98.224625,10.133,right i don't thin- well i think once my uh child got to be maybe four years old i might feel a little better about a larger group setting,1,0
sw3249A-ms98-a,43,A,211.240125,216.278875,5.03875,so i would really be hard pressed to find something that i felt like was quality child care ,1,0
sw3249B-ms98-a,50,B,164.604375,177.764,13.159625,and it looked when the parents visited it looked like um that everything looked fine and they told them one ratio of adults to kids and and and that appeared to be what what the case when they were there but then,1,0
sw3249B-ms98-a,61,B,234.743125,240.64275,5.899625,um to do because there are many times when another salary would be real helpful,1,0

sw3256A-ms98-a,30,A,148.50575,160.78,12.27425,unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse i guess you know a lot of and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved and,1,0
sw3256A-ms98-a,46,A,269.737,273.636,3.899,um-hum that would be pretty lenient in my opinion,1,0
sw3256B-ms98-a,10,B,57.84275,66.717625,8.874875,i guess before i'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it has to be a an absolute certainty ,1,0
sw3256B-ms98-a,16,B,102.9905,113.518875,10.528375,well but i can't see that either i don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent ag- uh you know reason to not use capital punishment,1,0
sw3256B-ms98-a,34,B,242.113125,256.171625,14.0585,you know type thing now Texas is capital punishment for it used to be just capital murder and now the- they added mass murder are those the only two things that we uh,1,0

sw3265B-ms98-a,29,B,188.831,200.408125,11.577125,if they held their value that would be one thing but when you consider that when you drive them_1 off of the show lot they're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated,1,0
sw3266A-ms98-a,20,A,77.859375,83.084,5.224625,i've always thought you know it would be really tough what if you had a fire or something with babies,1,0
sw3266A-ms98-a,21,A,83.084,87.9675,4.8835,you would have to be able to have enough you know you'd have to be able to get them_1 all out,2,0
sw3266A-ms98-a,47,A,184.873,189.96775,5.09475,babies are fun and they're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet so,1,0
sw3266B-ms98-a,19,B,62.3125,69.770125,7.457625,an- like in Pennsylvania for babies that's what i work with there has to be a one to four ratio at the most,1,0
sw3266B-ms98-a,35,B,144.222375,153.311625,9.08925,sometimes tha- i feel like all i'm doing is changing diapers giving bottles and putting babies down for a nap so it's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them,1,0
sw3266B-ms98-a,48,B,194.602625,203.051,8.448375,you have to be real careful all the everything is baby proof you know all the doors have latches and stuff so they can't get into anything but they try,1,0

sw3268A-ms98-a,57,A,219.996875,223.939875,3.943,it would be sort of c- i feel like it would be confining,2,0

sw3270A-ms98-a,44,A,228.709,233.27075,4.56175,so a lot of things that they're saying that they're no longer gonna be doing for,1,0
sw3270B-ms98-a,27,B,120.500125,126.80975,6.309625,and i think that that may be more widespread,1,0
sw3271A-ms98-a,8,A,42.09525,52.59625,10.501,i don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a pe- you know another dog and we do have a very loving cat that's you know kind of our baby,1,0
sw3271A-ms98-a,47,A,288.981125,298.562,9.580875,get a dog get a dog    i'm saying be quiet be quiet an- and i can tell my husband you know deep down he you know he rea-,2,0
sw3271B-ms98-a,13,B,66.4245,79.91375,13.48925,we you know if it um if it were just more peaceful you know with the little ones we would definitely have a pet i just think it's nice have around we had a cat though that had kittens so any pet that i get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered,1,0
sw3271B-ms98-a,40,B,198.559625,207.496125,8.9365,so i guess it's probably probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat even though i love cats i think it would probably be a dog and it would definitely be an outdoor animal,3,0
sw3271B-ms98-a,47,B,234.11425,245.8405,11.72625,they just i- needs to be put to sleep but it's grandpa's dog and h- he is really getting too old to take care of it but the dog messes all over the carpet and my daughter is just nine months old,1,0
sw3272A-ms98-a,18,A,87.08175,97.909625,10.827875,for years and it's people are desperate and there might be a revolution within the people  but i don't think the US would get involved with it because uh there's too close of ties to where ,1,0
sw3272A-ms98-a,21,A,117.69175,124.47225,6.7805,might be something that i'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons versus a a small,2,0
sw3272A-ms98-a,25,A,145.810125,156.984625,11.1745,to them that would be a suicide and they and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people but if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of,1,0
sw3272B-ms98-a,16,B,164.808,174.917125,10.109125,uh the Russian people i think are not that much different from us you know i think they're that it would be the leadership that i'd i'd uh mistrust,1,0
sw3273A-ms98-a,33,A,98.616125,104.647,6.030875,yeah where i was hired they made us sign something saying that we could be um put through one at any time,1,0
sw3273B-ms98-a,3,B,1.74875,14.71175,12.963,um i think  just fine  but um i just worry about some things that show up as drugs that aren't like i've heard poppy seeds come up to be like opium i think they're in the same family,1,0
sw3273B-ms98-a,21,B,67.835375,79.163625,11.32825,i've just heard that the random testing like drawing a name out of a hat or whatever is just so they can't be accused of you know picking on someone in particular that they're suspicious about you know,1,0

sw3274A-ms98-a,47,A,194.536625,203.90825,9.371625,certain chemicals but everybody is so chemical shy anymore that we steered clear of it and hopefully you know come s- come spring it will be cleared up and everything will be back to normal,2,0
sw3274B-ms98-a,6,B,31.430375,35.511,4.080625,and uh delightful to be outside,1,0

sw3276A-ms98-a,5,A,25.472375,40.1235,14.651125,everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits,1,0
sw3276A-ms98-a,7,A,49.137,61.58925,12.45225,uh individuals um helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how but uh the expenses right now for health care um are just unreal,1,0

sw3276A-ms98-a,19,A,109.7935,122.63175,12.83825,uh they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason but most people that go in to being a physician here in the US do it for financial gain,1,0
sw3276A-ms98-a,29,A,190.8685,200.443125,9.574625,uh and that's sad because if that's the case i- if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway but,2,0
sw3276A-ms98-a,30,A,200.443125,207.502625,7.0595,that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind,1,0
sw3276B-ms98-a,5,B,24.5065,27.287125,2.780625,you should still be ,1,0

sw3277B-ms98-a,17,B,96.173125,104.5285,8.355375,you know do you wanna spend about thirty thousand dollars and uh it'd probably be a little over that with the tax  so that's that's really where,1,0
sw3277B-ms98-a,23,B,139.43525,147.3735,7.93825,right well it can be comfortable but those things not all the seat belts are gonna work that way nor can i get all the seats up high enough,1,0

sw3289A-ms98-a,28,A,131.462,136.7385,5.2765,it would be better to have them have judges trained professionals deciding such things,1,0
sw3289A-ms98-a,43,A,221.385,231.88725,10.50225,this is be- because of  not who initially comes in but who's selected out of the panel uh okay certainly both sides,1,0
sw3289B-ms98-a,11,B,75.14575,77.575125,2.429375,i'm not going to be reimbursed by no one ,1,0

sw3289B-ms98-a,25,B,166.92625,177.142625,10.216375,and helping to make decisions although we'd have problems as to who qualifies to be on that uh jury and i think some of the the ,1,0
sw3289B-ms98-a,26,B,177.142625,186.8735,9.730875, manipulative rules that they use to say that all the rich and famous cannot be on a jury but all the poor dregs can be you know it d- it doesn't make sense ,2,0
sw3289B-ms98-a,29,B,196.275875,204.134375,7.8585,and your really high on society somehow another you're going come up with a one of these excuse that the the the judge gonna say yeah you're excused you don't have to be here ,1,0
sw3289B-ms98-a,44,B,270.898875,277.673625,6.77475,and then when you get someone who says okay this person should be convicted for thirty years two years later they're on probation,1,0
sw3289B-ms98-a,45,B,277.673625,287.60275,9.929125,because the jury doesn't know and in in the state of Texas i don't think you are allowed uh the jury's not allowed to be told how soon that person would be off on probation ,2,0
sw3289B-ms98-a,46,B,287.60275,291.6455,4.04275,only thing that they can do is determine how long they should be put in jail,1,0

sw3291A-ms98-a,19,A,155.17575,168.797875,13.622125,maybe i'm a little bit strong when i said total gun -tro- control that's that's really not what i meant by i mean we need control we've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the in the in the public ,1,0
sw3291A-ms98-a,31,A,278.114125,287.612125,9.498,i think  i think that's totally outrageous what's happening is people are losing they seem to be losing their common sense over the issue,1,0

sw3291B-ms98-a,35,B,239.787625,249.99775,10.210125,just just from a technical point of view that interests me not to kill anybody with it or anything with it but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate,2,0
sw3292A-ms98-a,34,A,188.964125,191.888375,2.92425,it will be interesting to see how many keep with it,1,0
sw3293B-ms98-a,38,B,188.58775,195.185,6.59725,there would be oh maybe twenty twenty five of us because_1 it would be all of my mother's family you know and all my cousins and it,2,0
sw3294A-ms98-a,17,A,98.056125,102.499125,4.443,and the people making these calls would be obliged to c- compare,1,0

sw3294A-ms98-a,36,A,161.59425,167.0105,5.41625,and these and these people may in fact be just looking to s- find an unoccupied house to rob,1,0
sw3294A-ms98-a,59,A,240.766,249.995375,9.229375,marketing purpose for which if they would just pay me enough money i would be willing to consider but but a dollar isn't it you know it's  uh,1,0
sw3294A-ms98-a,64,A,274.5805,280.784375,6.203875,this isn't you know prob- most likely not to going to be used against you but it could and,1,0
sw3294A-ms98-a,65,A,280.784375,284.75075,3.966375,and that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed,2,0
sw3294B-ms98-a,11,B,55.4575,67.656875,12.199375, oh i that's that's interesting i uh uh the market seems to just be growing too i i guess enough people are not speaking out i'm not speaking out that's for sure i just get aggravated about it and,1,0

sw3342A-ms98-a,65,A,254.81825,269.270125,14.451875,um-hum well that's kind of we've never entered a tournament or anything we're not that big into fishing but i see a lot of people you know early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out and they'll say well there's a big bass tournament this weekend and all those people are here for the tournament you know,1,0
sw3342A-ms98-a,69,A,280.633125,290.50475,9.871625,but it is it's very a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out in on the water and looking around the peace and calmness is really relaxing,2,0
sw3343A-ms98-a,39,A,213.26575,221.00575,7.74,yeah my husband is really good at fixing things too so he'll usually be able to fix anything that's minor and,1,0

sw3345A-ms98-a,54,A,236.044625,243.46325,7.418625,but i think the quality of our uh our news is just uh i don't believe it could be better,1,0
sw3345A-ms98-a,58,A,251.033375,253.072,2.038625,i don't think our news could be better,1,0
sw3345A-ms98-a,62,A,266.521875,272.65075,6.128875,well you always wanna think everything can be improved upon i i r- i understand what you're saying,1,0

sw3345B-ms98-a,68,B,277.01275,287.331625,10.318875,well that may be so yeah uh i think that i'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into th- how deep they dig into the things and such ,1,0
sw3346A-ms98-a,13,A,35.43125,42.638125,7.206875,um-hum i- i thought it would be good too but i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps,2,0
sw3346A-ms98-a,15,A,48.888125,56.49525,7.607125,because_1 i think it takes a certain person to to be able to do something like that but there's a lot of other public service things that could be done,2,0
sw3346A-ms98-a,26,A,78.2805,88.91075,10.63025,yeah i think it would be  when they say this proposal is this something that they're just suggesting or are they actually wh- wh- why did they call it a proposal that,1,0
sw3346A-ms98-a,33,A,99.98375,102.649375,2.665625,it'd be a good character builder,1,0
sw3346A-ms98-a,61,A,196.44775,204.627875,8.180125,now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years i don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done,2,0
sw3346A-ms98-a,68,A,227.472875,233.101375,5.6285,and something course now Peace Corps that couldn't be done of course until they were done with school,1,0
sw3346A-ms98-a,86,A,273.10525,278.7165,5.61125,no and and like i said not now all young people should be able to do something but,1,0
sw3346A-ms98-a,87,A,278.7165,292.648875,13.932375,not all certainly would be geared to even the the Mormon boys that go out not all of them go i mean it's disaster if they don't go but  but some of them are not they're just not made to do that type of thing,1,0
sw3346B-ms98-a,3,B,3.273125,15.410875,12.13775,well um i- i just think the way that things are going that um that it would be good for young people to go ahead and have um dedicate themselves to at least something,1,0
sw3346B-ms98-a,5,B,22.559875,32.8605,10.300625,yeah and um so but i think it would be good if for all young people you know to be able to to do something like that um so that um you know,2,0
sw3346B-ms98-a,6,B,32.8605,36.32225,3.46175,i- i- i don't know i just feel it would be good for them_1 to do that,1,0
sw3346B-ms98-a,19,B,114.67275,125.712125,11.039375,um they don't even have a direction to give their their time to so i think it would be really good for people to um to be able to give their time i- in uh some kind of public service uh even in our government,2,0
sw3346B-ms98-a,21,B,130.1515,133.93,3.7785,so um yeah it would be uh it'd be really good i think,2,0
sw3346B-ms98-a,32,B,181.573,188.96825,7.39525,you know to get a taste of what the real world is actually about uh you know doing that that public service would be great yeah,1,0
sw3346B-ms98-a,48,B,256.350375,266.222375,9.872,um-hum yeah so to me see that would be the the uh the greatest time for um you know uh teenagers to to do that would be right after they graduated from high school,2,0
sw3346B-ms98-a,57,B,294.18725,299.842,5.65475,yeah yeah so um yeah it'd be good but like i said it requiring it would be uh,2,0

sw3351B-ms98-a,51,B,220.381125,226.3535,5.972375,so we said the next time around we'd get     something happened it would be easier to carry,1,0
sw3352A-ms98-a,24,A,61.32625,64.959875,3.633625,i've  i've been in that area and the trout fishing's supposed to be legendary,1,0

sw3353A-ms98-a,23,A,109.35475,115.306,5.95125,it always had to be somewhere near a a river so we could go fishing and hopefully we'd catch our supper but we never did,1,0

sw3357A-ms98-a,8,A,43.206375,54.005625,10.79925,well i think anything from you know building a house uh to cabinetry would be woodworking i mean i- i think that would be classified that you built a tree house  pretty good,2,0
sw3357A-ms98-a,28,A,188.453,195.905625,7.452625,i think that'd be more for the professional if you're gonna do it as a business uh those types of tools are fine,1,0
sw3358A-ms98-a,19,A,130.998375,143.692875,12.6945, i mean it must be great to to to really understand what's what's going on and you can both do things yourself and  talk confidently with people when you have to take it somewhere to get parts or whatever,1,0
sw3358A-ms98-a,32,A,232.000125,238.082375,6.08225,where various things are are going wrong with it and it's had to be in recently,1,0
sw3358B-ms98-a,12,B,64.31675,73.045625,8.728875,and then it started raining so i haven't been able to do it for another week so i'll have to take it over there and get it charged again and maybe i'll be able to see if that won't get it going tomorrow,1,0
sw3358B-ms98-a,32,B,161.73675,171.155125,9.418375,and i've tried to put a racing clutch in it which i think is gonna you know i think that may be what my problem is it's it's too much clutch for the amount of engine i've got,1,0
sw3359B-ms98-a,5,B,8.05125,13.507875,5.456625, well i I try to be as well ,1,0

sw3359B-ms98-a,37,B,156.734625,161.20725,4.472625,but it sure is good and it's supposed to be good for you,1,0
sw3360A-ms98-a,3,A,22.45,26.874625,4.424625, i think that's just a bit too much to be paying them ah,1,0
sw3360B-ms98-a,13,B,78.611625,80.86275,2.251125,i think it can be,1,0

sw3361A-ms98-a,6,A,9.636625,21.128,11.491375,how do you feel about the knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth what do you think would be required and so forth,1,0
sw3361A-ms98-a,40,A,191.0975,205.591125,14.493625,of course since i see her only once or twice a year i was just thrilled to have her here with me and i spent every minute i could to be with her and uh cooking foods for her you know just to make her her life as though she were on vacation,1,0
sw3361B-ms98-a,9,B,61.208625,73.89175,12.683125,uh  go i guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that to to make sure that you went daily you know and made sure that they were cared for and,1,0
sw3361B-ms98-a,15,B,109.741375,123.086625,13.34525,so i know how she feels about it you know if i uh if i ever had to put her there i think uh it would be probably when i just could not handle it any more you know if i,1,0
sw3361B-ms98-a,16,B,123.086625,132.35325,9.266625,she got to the point where she was totally bedridden and and i mean i just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed i think that would be the,1,0
sw3361B-ms98-a,19,B,148.540625,156.180375,7.63975,i think it's very hard for her um to be waited upon so to speak i mean i think it's hard for her to,1,0
sw3361B-ms98-a,46,B,262.26975,268.914375,6.644625,well that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's as you say lived on a farm for sixty years and then,1,0
sw3363A-ms98-a,12,A,42.963125,48.505625,5.5425,but i think i'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway but uh,1,0
sw3363A-ms98-a,26,A,122.93075,136.543875,13.613125,so uh i have really been impressed i said i'll probably never be able to find another one that i can afford you know but i have loved this car better than anything i've ever driven because you you can go on the road and get there and you're not even tired,1,0
sw3363A-ms98-a,54,A,284.637375,296.710625,12.07325,that's right but it's really it's been an enjoyable car like i say i'll probably never be able to have another one because i think we bought it for about sixteen thousand you know and i said i'll never find another one for that price,1,0
sw3363B-ms98-a,5,B,17.6255,30.39275,12.76725,so forth and we have another four door car that i drive to work and i think it'd be more economical if i were able to get a smaller car and uh wouldn't be wouldn't cost much with gas,2,0

sw3375B-ms98-a,3,B,11.52925,22.984625,11.455375,uh that might be a lot to do with it i know a lot of it here in my state i'm from Mississippi i'm not sure where you're from Minnesota okay well a lot of it in Mississippi here is got to do with funding,1,0
sw3375B-ms98-a,10,B,46.9965,59.770125,12.773625,that's true and a lot of it lot of it has to do with uh salaries too speaking of money because_1 if you can't pay the right people you know they're not going to be able to do they're not not gonna get the people that can do a good job,1,0
sw3375B-ms98-a,20,B,109.5075,114.846625,5.339125,i feel that's got a lot to do with it people aren't as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be,1,0

sw3379A-ms98-a,26,A,149.225625,159.187,9.961375,just on an economic point of view if the Soviet Union doesn't do something fast they're they ain't gonna be able to feed their people this this winter you know but,1,0
sw3379A-ms98-a,37,A,214.593125,223.969625,9.3765,that i feel we ought to be concentrating more on i think the problem is and on the international scope,1,0
sw3379B-ms98-a,6,B,28.91575,41.643,12.72725,and never to this extent though you know so so it's like there is a struggle within me going do do i be open minded and give them_1 the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality you know i i trust people i'll do that,1,0
sw3379B-ms98-a,28,B,174.818125,186.903,12.084875, and i'm not against them being concerned but i feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own,1,0

sw3443A-ms98-a,16,A,66.0855,68.77625,2.69075,but that would be my main objection,1,0
sw3443A-ms98-a,23,A,96.837625,102.2125,5.374875,but uh i don't know so- some kids are so spoiled nowadays it might be a real eye opener you ,1,0

sw3443A-ms98-a,29,A,138.537875,143.594375,5.0565,seems to me we uh it be to our benefit to strengthen that country,1,0

sw3444A-ms98-a,62,A,274.751875,282.9865,8.234625,right drug testing could uh could be the first step towards that so i hope they do it very very carefully and uh,1,0

sw3444B-ms98-a,25,B,124.88525,136.63675,11.7515,but i think if um  if there's any suspicion that a person is using drugs i think that the employer should be able to do a little bit of testing,1,0
sw3444B-ms98-a,35,B,191.32075,202.27325,10.9525,one of those things that i know at least in our area is it provides properly which should be you know kind of comforting to people who have to have it done ,1,0

sw3446B-ms98-a,47,B,241.9335,254.63825,12.70475,because you know when you're just starting out you don't know what type of clubs to use you know what's the best for you and so there's no sense in buying a set and then finding out later that you really should be using something else,1,0
sw3447A-ms98-a,26,A,107.375625,119.9235,12.547875,and the people that don't uh i don't know if you noticed if i wanna say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like i used to be in that research and i guess you are that we dress in the jeans and then there's kind of the,1,0

sw3465B-ms98-a,54,B,176.679,188.88525,12.20625,you know i- i think maybe it might not be too bad of an idea  you y- i don't know if you've seen the movie where the the principal cracks down on the kids and he says okay let me know who all the trouble makers are and they're out of here,1,0

sw3466B-ms98-a,49,B,176.66625,184.3445,7.67825,it was a little riot almost broke out so it was we happened to be in a restaurant across the street you know nice seats but,1,0
sw3466B-ms98-a,68,B,227.770625,231.209,3.438375,how to be a w- w- a well rounded individual i guess so,1,0

sw3467A-ms98-a,44,A,191.444625,200.39025,8.945625,and i guess we just kept sitting there and then now we make a point of  i can't take all these shows on because next semester i'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television,1,0
sw3467A-ms98-a,45,A,200.39025,207.696875,7.306625,well then it will be mostly reruns i guess  it's uh by the end of February the way they do it nowadays,1,0
sw3467A-ms98-a,63,A,268.956375,275.08,6.123625,i know everybody was saying that and then in the paper said it so it should be interesting,1,0
sw3467B-ms98-a,27,B,102.377125,109.6655,7.288375,oh gosh well he could very well be  so do you watch much TV or,1,0

sw3468B-ms98-a,42,B,176.29375,180.29975,4.006,so that's gonna be a good deal i won't have to worry about that,1,0
sw3469A-ms98-a,30,A,95.704125,104.410875,8.70675,and i just i don't know i have personally i have a problem with it i think that you know if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that,1,0
sw3469A-ms98-a,41,A,143.68475,146.308125,2.623375,but there could be some work done in the area,1,0
sw3469A-ms98-a,48,A,175.686875,181.024875,5.338,yeah and i think you know it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent you know,1,0
sw3469A-ms98-a,49,A,181.024875,190.42575,9.400875,and that it should be equal to all and then not like the United States basically it's not who you know it d- it doesn't become a thing of who you know but but how the type of person you are,1,0
sw3469A-ms98-a,50,A,190.42575,195.21575,4.79,and it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people like probably your husband can get ,1,0
sw3469A-ms98-a,58,A,208.883,211.360875,2.477875,no i'm not sure how long they're supposed to be but,1,0
sw3469B-ms98-a,4,B,11.9545,21.98475,10.03025,we had to go through a whole very long process to uh to assure the government that he was uh marrying me and not to be a resident here,1,0
sw3469B-ms98-a,24,B,103.897125,109.12,5.222875,exactly if they're not going to be on welfare or or whatever they're going to be a productive citizen,2,0
sw3470A-ms98-a,45,A,183.862875,195.788875,11.926,that's the problem i agree with you used to be you could you could repair and do all those things yourself and there's there's so much p- i- i think the antipollution stuff is what really fouls up a lot of engines,1,0
sw3470B-ms98-a,3,B,4.700125,11.509875,6.80975,uh that uh to be real honest i'm thinking about a truck as opposed to a car,1,0
sw3470B-ms98-a,14,B,81.184,93.892625,12.708625, at least i mean the the the year model that i had was one that that um they say that those engines are built to be completely torn down and rebuilt like at least three times ,1,0
sw3470B-ms98-a,36,B,211.850875,222.466625,10.61575,we can sure have engineers that can sit down and design a fairly efficient engine that would also be good for the environment,1,0
sw3472A-ms98-a,44,A,256.236375,269.477375,13.241,oh it is unbelievable and we keep saying that one of these days our kids are getting older now they're in college and uh be getting married and whatever so we doubt we'll ever have the opportunity to go back with our with our kids but but we're certainly going back but,1,0
sw3472B-ms98-a,31,B,174.2755,180.42575,6.15025,and they have there's a sanctuary there there was supposed to be some uh miracle healing that occurred there,1,0
sw3473A-ms98-a,28,A,146.21725,152.276,6.05875,example this summer i- i was about fifteen pounds heavier than i wanted to be so i- i increased,1,0
sw3473B-ms98-a,76,B,245.819,254.5955,8.7765,yeah yeah well i uh i uh i keep saying if somebody else would do it with me i  that would be a little bit of peer pressure would help considerably,1,0
sw3474A-ms98-a,44,A,103.57675,106.406625,2.829875,they'd throw it and he'd be right there on it,1,0
sw3474A-ms98-a,102,A,270.99975,275.524125,4.524375,except it's windy if the wind wasn't blowing it'd be really nice,1,0
sw3474B-ms98-a,10,B,14.690375,19.1165,4.426125,uh oh she's about she'll be three in February,1,0

sw3474B-ms98-a,71,B,183.946375,186.616375,2.67,oh yeah that's got to be hard,1,0
sw3474B-ms98-a,92,B,245.14625,247.991125,2.844875,yeah i guess if you care about them_1 they'll be better pets,1,0
sw3475A-ms98-a,6,A,8.239,19.78725,11.54825,yeah it's amazing to me the people that uh i've i've got a brother and sister-in-law that uh like whenever i go to visit them_1 i'll always have to be sure and carry a book with me  there's nothing to read in their house and i go crazy,1,0
sw3475A-ms98-a,49,A,278.924875,286.523875,7.599,Monday through Friday so it's you know it's great and that makes it i- i- you know if they were just regular hours then it would be difficult because i'm,1,0
sw3475B-ms98-a,8,B,18.27275,29.33375,11.061,yeah i i pretty much carry my own reading material too i mean i'll uh i'll be walking to wor- i mean walking to the elevator to work and i'll be reading a book on the way up in the elevator and everybody laughs at me,2,0
sw3476A-ms98-a,7,A,11.363375,16.214375,4.851, um i guess i'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system,1,0
sw3476A-ms98-a,21,A,66.330375,73.54325,7.212875,but i g- guess it's it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be,1,0
sw3476A-ms98-a,22,A,73.54325,79.61025,6.067,uh be- be- because of of uh of computers coming into everything,2,0
sw3476A-ms98-a,28,A,114.037875,118.9985,4.960625,that something can be posed upon uh by government will,1,0
sw3476A-ms98-a,48,A,239.75525,242.66675,2.9115,eighty eighty five whatever would be the appropriate number,1,0
sw3476A-ms98-a,50,A,243.772125,256.12975,12.357625,hundred car is going sixty two yeah so it would be more like uh like ninety i guess car is going fifty five uh you suddenly have a  have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now,1,0
sw3476B-ms98-a,24,B,118.884625,121.329625,2.445,yeah no one seems to be adopting it,1,0
sw3477A-ms98-a,25,A,117.775625,124.379875,6.60425,right yeah we could use our Social Security number or something there ought to be some way that they could safe guard it but,1,0
sw3477A-ms98-a,36,A,180.93,184.89025,3.96025,you know i think that may be part of it too they're not really informed,1,0
sw3477B-ms98-a,45,B,145.049375,153.248375,8.199,i wonder if it's the younger people or the older people or just in the middle-aged or or who it is that doesn't turn out my guess would be the younger,1,0
sw3477B-ms98-a,83,B,278.492375,282.988625,4.49625,oh oh yeah that would be they probably can turn those results in,1,0
sw3478A-ms98-a,37,A,188.3665,197.02025,8.65375,right now she's got terrible arthritis in her knees and it's probably not real long where she won't be able to you know get along on her own and she probably,1,0
sw3478A-ms98-a,38,A,197.02025,209.006125,11.985875,you know hopefully it will be a number of years but she's seventy nine years old right now and now she understands that someday you know if she can't handle her apartment that uh you know she'll have to go in the nursing home,1,0
sw3478B-ms98-a,26,B,147.28725,157.59325,10.306,well it is sad i think i don't think for me it would be as hard a decision if their minds were gone i think it's a harder decision if they're still,1,0
sw3478B-ms98-a,27,B,157.59325,167.549625,9.956375,i- if their minds are still good but they're completely  their bodies are gone you know i think that would be really hard to put someone in a nursing home in that situation um,1,0
sw3478B-ms98-a,28,B,167.549625,179.63925,12.089625, you know i think there's some times when you there's just nothing else that can be done but i my uh my father's dead and and so i just have my mother and she's in real good health but i would hate to have to make that decision for her um,1,0

sw3482B-ms98-a,60,B,207.85175,218.74125,10.8895,because we both work and they required someone to be     and quite honestly i think probably some dogs got put to sleep that could've had a good home i mean,1,0

sw3484B-ms98-a,26,B,154.003625,165.30725,11.303625,being i'm a contract person with Texas Instruments and before i could even go to work here i had to be drug tested you know and they do a random drug testing of their employees,1,0
sw3484B-ms98-a,41,B,250.6115,265.028375,14.416875,yeah this this program you know encompasses everything but you know i thought you know it's not an instant dismissal if you are found to be taking drugs which i think you know is good and it's good on T- TI's part as i said i think they give you three chances,1,0
sw3485A-ms98-a,17,A,58.143375,71.138875,12.9955,my clothing doesn't need to be probably as fancy as yours  but um you know mostly during the day i wear the the casual type things and and i have the sweaters and the in the winter and fall and,1,0

sw3485B-ms98-a,52,B,222.921875,232.341875,9.42,i get up pretty early and then school comes after that so i just don't bother to change for school unless i really want to be casual  but,1,0
sw3486B-ms98-a,8,B,41.4715,47.920875,6.449375,oh see that would be fun  yeah,1,0
sw3486B-ms98-a,19,B,114.7455,125.82925,11.08375,but um it used to be you did those things to relax but now i don't think there's time to relax   so there is not very much time for that but um,1,0
sw3486B-ms98-a,49,B,268.3435,271.41025,3.06675,you've got to be careful ,1,0
sw3487B-ms98-a,11,B,31.7015,43.2295,11.528,let's see when i when i went away to school i'm trying to think my criteria i guess when you're when you're eighteen or so um it would be important to know if it was a coed college  that was a,1,0
sw3487B-ms98-a,14,B,56.40625,69.665,13.25875,i guess i'd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home,1,0
sw3487B-ms98-a,22,B,95.2075,105.839,10.6315,yes and also um depending on how um uh  adjustable your child would be or or flexible i guess it would be um,2,0
sw3487B-ms98-a,25,B,121.012375,135.84275,14.830375,you have to be more flexible and more willing to um um adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things you know you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across,3,0
sw3487B-ms98-a,34,B,152.387625,161.39575,9.008125,well climate would be you know you'd have to you know is somewhat if uh if it's something different than the what they used to i guess um,1,0
sw3487B-ms98-a,35,B,161.39575,173.74275,12.347,if they're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need to go out and play all the time not be  in  if you're in Florida or California um,1,0
sw3488A-ms98-a,30,A,235.8795,244.281,8.4015, and and unfortunately those people who m- in my book i would i would consider them to be terribly uninformed,1,0
sw3488A-ms98-a,31,A,244.281,255.860625,11.579625,might be deemed the most eligible people  be put on the jury  while l- like you said earlier i don't necessarily would  i don't  i'd consider them to be a jury of my peers,3,0
sw3488A-ms98-a,32,A,255.860625,267.021625,11.161,you know so i but that's well you know one of the reasons why i hope i never have to be in a   have a jury listen to what  a case of mine and i hope i never you know am in that situation,1,0
sw3488B-ms98-a,9,B,83.392625,95.3525,11.959875,i uh i don't know i look at the people who get excused and and it's supposed to be a jury of your peers and i'm not sure it always is uh,1,0
sw3488B-ms98-a,24,B,209.564125,220.493,10.928875,and i don't you know in today's age of television the coverage like it is there's no way that you can be shielded from it,1,0
sw3489A-ms98-a,2,A,8.487625,22.7765,14.288875,right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the by the collection agency or the the city,1,0
sw3489A-ms98-a,5,A,44.434375,55.302875,10.8685,that will be rolled out to everyone i hope in the next year or so and those that aren't participating they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum,1,0
sw3489A-ms98-a,29,A,141.839,147.313375,5.474375, well let's hope not you can be uh get in trouble for that,1,0
sw3489A-ms98-a,56,A,208.021,220.764,12.743, well uh if a lot of people did that th- then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail that's a great idea i hadn't thought about that and we might be able to incorporate some of that one thing,1,0
sw3489B-ms98-a,23,B,163.651625,168.857,5.205375,well what what it'll be you just you drive up on the jack but you it won't go down,1,0
sw3490A-ms98-a,4,A,18.914,27.378125,8.464125, who could be worth that huh ,1,0
sw3490A-ms98-a,6,A,40.837625,48.195125,7.3575,i i think they'd be better off trading him off for two million and a half dollar a year pitchers they can win some twelve games each,1,0
sw3490A-ms98-a,10,A,66.386125,75.07575,8.689625,i think you're right i i think that as long as they they keep that uh management team i don't think there is going to be a winner i agree with you,1,0
sw3490A-ms98-a,35,A,241.4825,252.731625,11.249125,and are respectable they don't make a you know they aren't going to pay the bucks out to be a winner and lose money and that's apparently what it takes  what it what what it's taking right now,1,0
sw3490B-ms98-a,16,B,55.579,66.902,11.323,you got a uh they've got to resign them just to keep the credibility of this franchise i mean because if they don't resign them i mean that's pretty much going to be the last straw they've kept Val- Valentine way too long,1,0
sw3491B-ms98-a,20,B,57.4435,66.76025,9.31675,except that the rumor is is that they still might but it may not include the entire crew and it will be a next generation meets this generation,1,0
sw3492A-ms98-a,3,A,2.010375,9.4655,7.455125,football our favorite football teams and it doesn't sound like to you yours will be the Dallas Cowboys with your accent,1,0
sw3492A-ms98-a,25,A,75.095,79.973625,4.878625,you don't think Parcells saw the handwriting and thought he'd be better to go out as a winner,1,0
sw3493A-ms98-a,43,A,168.495875,175.00525,6.509375,oh okay well this happened in Plano  you'll be thrilled to know ,1,0
sw3493A-ms98-a,54,A,220.19925,228.04825,7.849,but all they can do there is three questions that they have to evaluate one being could he be a future threat to people well he's already proven that,1,0
sw3494B-ms98-a,16,B,89.776625,99.18,9.403375,yeah i worked today i i just you know there working towards year end there's just so much going on that that you can't afford to be gone you know,1,0
sw3494B-ms98-a,48,B,258.05375,268.9375,10.88375,i bet you at the end of those roots there might be something and so i had my little you know i couldn't cast because_1 the tree's hanging over and brush and everything so i just kind of,1,0
sw3495A-ms98-a,5,A,21.188,32.621125,11.433125,drugs seems to be re- related to quite a bit of the crime we have now there is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with uh people trying to get money for drugs,1,0
sw3495A-ms98-a,55,A,278.34425,282.031625,3.687375,uh they're not nearly as selective as they used to be,1,0
sw3496A-ms98-a,45,A,200.48425,204.67925,4.195,oh yeah that would be nice,1,0
sw3496B-ms98-a,34,B,131.327,138.35475,7.02775,were you well you know well i think if we ever go it will only be for a three day now we've been real lucky we've been to Europe twice,1,0
sw3497A-ms98-a,30,A,79.01,92.160875,13.150875,because_1 i i noticed when i got here too because_1 like i'd when it would snow in Texas um i would just i mean we'd be fr- really cold and we'd have to get really warm and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing and you you don't,1,0
sw3497A-ms98-a,53,A,151.1895,155.500625,4.311125,oh man it's got to be like it's probably,1,0
sw3497A-ms98-a,84,A,230.0675,234.20825,4.14075,so but i'll be here a long time ,1,0
sw3497B-ms98-a,46,B,176.578,182.86625,6.28825,they said it could be like six degrees outside and like negative forty one wind chill,1,0
sw3498A-ms98-a,4,A,18.1035,22.788,4.6845,and so it's basically we're taught to be mediocre in what we learn,1,0
sw3498A-ms98-a,54,A,278.919625,288.508,9.588375,and you know like you said i i like the point that you brought up that that you said really i- it needs to be individualized and i think as that happens more that the schooling will become better,1,0
sw3498B-ms98-a,6,B,33.18675,42.160375,8.973625,and um i think there is a lot of problems in that area a i think there is problems all over the education system whether it be,1,0
sw3498B-ms98-a,27,B,159.016,163.762125,4.746125,find different ways and be creative on their teaching,1,0
sw3499A-ms98-a,24,A,116.36275,121.04,4.67725,and so we budgeted and we said well we'll be extravagant we budgeted ten dollars a day,1,0
sw3500A-ms98-a,73,A,258.584125,268.544625,9.9605,yeah i know you can be human and Catholic but you're not likely to find somebody who is going to you know have a less conscientious effort i mean,1,0
sw3500B-ms98-a,53,B,256.805875,259.45775,2.651875,well you can be human and Catholic,1,0
sw3501A-ms98-a,4,A,20.833625,31.094,10.260375,and we went ahead and got this one for my little girl from her great-grandma and it's turned out to be a very good pet she or he is,1,0
sw3502A-ms98-a,11,A,90.986625,98.275625,7.289,so you like ha- having the flexibility to be able to take off time when you want to that's important to you,1,0
sw3502A-ms98-a,27,A,260.12975,268.826125,8.696375,okay uh David is one of the things that i- i suppose so you don't want to be out in the weather and,1,0
sw3502A-ms98-a,28,A,268.826125,278.3505,9.524375,uh the environment like construction workers for you it's better to be inside air-conditioned w- warm,1,0
sw3502B-ms98-a,6,B,22.841375,27.97025,5.128875,and another thing would be um,1,0
sw3502B-ms98-a,20,B,84.28425,91.25275,6.9685,and so that's pretty good y- it would probably be hard to have something like that in another type of job,1,0
sw3502B-ms98-a,45,B,248.406,261.236125,12.830125,so this was the best thing because_1 um my post doctoral fellowship like this um um is a good thing on your resume for when you apply to be a professor or something like that,1,0
sw3503A-ms98-a,27,A,79.967125,86.46575,6.498625,yeah well i mean cases like that they should i mean if he's gonna be drastic somebody has to be drastic back,2,0
sw3503B-ms98-a,39,B,241.401875,248.983875,7.582,but what's it worth i don't know personally      i would pick if i had a choice for  that'd be interesting,1,0
sw3504A-ms98-a,10,A,36.61225,39.596,2.98375,i think that's gonna be the big problem,1,0
sw3504A-ms98-a,21,A,73.28375,82.025875,8.742125,draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here,1,0
sw3504A-ms98-a,61,A,249.468125,260.190625,10.7225,t- i mean it would be packed and they got that new stadium they're building so at least at least that'll be exciting  when we get that but,2,0
sw3504A-ms98-a,63,A,261.494875,268.591,7.096125,uh it's hard to say it's gonna be depending on where the what they do with Ruben Sierra and,1,0
sw3504B-ms98-a,6,B,17.570875,28.921875,11.351,with you know with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money twenty seven or twenty nine million or whatever it was i just don't think that they're gonna be able to sign Ruben Sierra and it's just gonna be a shame for you know our area ,2,0
sw3504B-ms98-a,16,B,63.113875,70.144875,7.031,i liked him but of course i understand baseball decisions are all just decisions like that have to be made by someone  it's not me making them_1,1,0
sw3504B-ms98-a,19,B,81.905,87.651625,5.746625,well they say as long as they draw up two million fans that Greave and Valentine'll be there,1,0
sw3504B-ms98-a,21,B,93.761375,101.818,8.056625,it's frightening you and i should be so lucky to you know to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat    ,1,0
sw3504B-ms98-a,32,B,177.06475,183.174375,6.109625,so that's that's going to be a big help to Dallas but you know in the past half a  years all we've had is the uh,1,0
sw3505B-ms98-a,44,B,173.013625,175.934375,2.92075,it'll be it'll be interesting,2,0
sw3506A-ms98-a,20,A,62.06275,66.458625,4.395875,yeah fresh vegetables would be good or um just,1,0
sw3506B-ms98-a,6,B,31.978375,36.486,4.507625,and what would that be like a clam or uh okay,1,0
sw3506B-ms98-a,14,B,72.393,80.481625,8.088625,and would you uh would it be appropriate to um drink with the uh prior when you have the hors d'oeuvres,1,0
sw3506B-ms98-a,21,B,97.014125,99.36725,2.353125,that would be my guess,1,0
sw3506B-ms98-a,41,B,192.132375,196.947,4.814625,that's more for like when friends come over and traditional yeah i wouldn't be the big uh,1,0
sw3506B-ms98-a,66,B,282.959375,284.84925,1.889875,oh that would be good,1,0
sw3507A-ms98-a,43,A,142.592,145.5715,2.9795,are you comfortable that Bobby Witt will be back,1,0
sw3507A-ms98-a,61,A,192.4075,200.02,7.6125,and i'm still not sure that that new third baseman Dean Palmer is as good as they think he's going to be,1,0
sw3508A-ms98-a,7,A,24.44725,33.483,9.03575,so we've done that for quite some time but since the price of paper has gone down like it's about a fifth of what it used to be,1,0
sw3508A-ms98-a,56,A,232.594625,240.7655,8.170875,but um they must be trying to keep track of you know who is doing it or what i guess i don't know another,1,0
sw3508A-ms98-a,68,A,290.4755,300.482,10.0065,oh and they must be yeah really expensive i mean of course we were hoping we weren't we weren't going to have to pay for it you know but i mean what would somebody do with them,1,0
sw3508B-ms98-a,52,B,238.146,243.41675,5.27075,yeah wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year ,1,0
sw3508B-ms98-a,55,B,246.196125,258.004875,11.80875,well except i know it would just be not cost effective they've already got all this money out on hired um getting the trucks and hiring people to work them i'm sure they couldn't afford that but um ,1,0
sw3509B-ms98-a,13,B,58.36825,64.542625,6.174375,um i you know i think to a certain degree the reason that it it doesn't serve as a deterrent uh may be because,1,0
sw3509B-ms98-a,14,B,64.542625,67.24975,2.707125,y- y- y- you never know if it's gonna be a- applied,1,0
sw3509B-ms98-a,29,B,134.76325,141.498875,6.735625,you know i do- i don't know if if it's a crime that's that's that serious that they're really never gonna be out of jail um ,1,0
sw3509B-ms98-a,60,B,283.177375,292.185875,9.0085,yeah i- i certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner i know that  i've always said that if i if i had to kill and clean and  my own my own meat i think i'd become a vegetarian,1,0
sw3510A-ms98-a,20,A,96.969125,104.1155,7.146375,well that that can be the case or it can get a great review and be something that i'm not interested in then i'm not going to see it,2,0
sw3510A-ms98-a,30,A,158.99225,170.8025,11.81025,well the newspaper suggested that it's perhaps too sweet a movie and and that the action sequences might not be as good as other Spielberg's movies but it might not be bad overall,2,0
sw3510A-ms98-a,44,A,255.1945,269.028625,13.834125,well i i've enjoyed Star Trek but i got people who are friends who are fanatics i have a friend who took off work last Friday just to be sure to be in the first group to see it well i'll see i'll see it eventually but i'm not going take the rush,2,0
sw3510A-ms98-a,46,A,272.625625,276.02625,3.400625,no i- i- i think it'll still be playing next month,1,0
sw3510B-ms98-a,30,B,170.346875,173.767875,3.421,i guess there'll never be another ET,1,0
sw3510B-ms98-a,49,B,275.112375,282.880625,7.76825,yeah i think so i don't think you need to be one of the first uh do you belong to any of the fan clubs uh you know the,1,0
sw3510B-ms98-a,53,B,296.611,300.002,3.391,yes well it'd be interesting to hear why people think that,1,0
sw3512A-ms98-a,19,A,68.288125,81.51375,13.225625,i really think American restaurants are all overall getting noisy and noisy people just screaming i say that because i  the time i was in Europe years ago you could be in a tiny little restaurant everyone talked lower they still seemed to have  ,1,0
sw3512A-ms98-a,49,A,233.77925,241.390625,7.611375,uh the more expensive the restaurant the more i want the h- the waiters to really wait on you and be good you know  remem-,1,0
sw3512A-ms98-a,54,A,256.150875,270.483,14.332125,and you know supposed to be one of the better ones in America and uh our dinner that night you could choose one that had like four courses and it was thirty nine dollars a dinner but my gosh it was worth it it was just beautiful surrounding and at one time there was five people waiting on our table,1,0
sw3512B-ms98-a,59,B,208.29875,209.836125,1.537375,i'll be happy,1,0
sw3512B-ms98-a,64,B,239.580625,242.756625,3.176,uh-huh well they should be i mean in theory i guess,1,0
sw3513B-ms98-a,20,B,84.16675,95.45775,11.291, while we're talking my next car i'd like to be sporty and you know nice but you know it's expensive and then insurance is really high for that too so,1,0
sw3513B-ms98-a,31,B,135.64925,144.2445,8.59525,unless i win the lottery i won't be buying anything too expensive i don't plan on buying a car for many many years  so,1,0
sw3514A-ms98-a,6,A,31.577125,37.713,6.135875,yeah it's that will be probably the most exciting place i'll ever get to go,1,0
sw3514A-ms98-a,43,A,213.329625,217.714,4.384375,we're going to take a cooking class there so that might be fun,1,0
sw3514B-ms98-a,28,B,97.919625,101.760125,3.8405,so yeah that turned out to be a really good experience for me,1,0
sw3514B-ms98-a,54,B,199.51975,204.4995,4.97975,hum how long do you plan to be going for,1,0
sw3515A-ms98-a,31,A,140.40625,149.410875,9.004625,but they they said they can't be smashed or else um it doesn't fit in their little containers and they're not reimbursed by the the people who are over them or something,1,0
sw3515A-ms98-a,53,A,250.566375,258.918,8.351625,um another thing i thought of i guess to recycle would be like clothes because i mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other,1,0
sw3516B-ms98-a,4,B,13.545375,22.63225,9.086875,probably we'd only be second to uh uh Los Angeles really as far as a a a major metropolitan area that's completely dependent upon,1,0
sw3516B-ms98-a,5,B,22.63225,32.0575,9.42525,automobiles there's just no real mass transit here and i think it's a a major drawback for Houston a a close runner up to that would be all of the uh,1,0
sw3516B-ms98-a,27,B,139.480375,153.8505,14.370125,and it's not i can't really say that it's any worse than it was as a matter of fact i think if anything a- the the air situation here might be a little bit better and i i think part of that has to do with uh the older cars are being phased off the road and the more modern,1,0
sw3516B-ms98-a,43,B,274.50575,287.056,12.55025,but uh i for one i'm just as guilty as the next person i want the convenience of going out there cranking up my car and driving to exactly where i want to go a- at exactly the time i want to go and not have to be dependent upon any schedule,1,0
sw3517A-ms98-a,44,A,170.13175,174.84425,4.7125,they'd all be pretty similar to one another within a a couple miles so,1,0
sw3518A-ms98-a,13,A,76.5495,87.422375,10.872875,well so let me make sure s- so you think that uh maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate,1,0
sw3518A-ms98-a,15,A,117.357125,122.536375,5.17925,uh you just you'd be able to buy it but they'd just have to mail it to you i suppose huh,1,0
sw3518A-ms98-a,28,A,181.20575,191.445375,10.239625,uh i would agree a a short waiting period would be appropriate to uh take care of the heat of the moment type things but,1,0
sw3518A-ms98-a,47,A,280.725375,282.059875,1.3345,can they be,1,0
sw3518A-ms98-a,50,A,285.896375,288.113875,2.2175,has to be on the hip,1,0
sw3518B-ms98-a,8,B,35.18275,46.3545,11.17175,um however i do believe that uh guns ought to be maintained and and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people,1,0
sw3518B-ms98-a,11,B,68.941625,76.852375,7.91075,but i think that there ought to be some control but i still think that uh individuals have a right how do you feel about it,1,0
sw3518B-ms98-a,13,B,87.335,95.748,8.413,well i don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate uh that uh,1,0
sw3518B-ms98-a,15,B,96.987875,107.291625,10.30375,that might cool down some tempers i think a a one day would be sufficient the reason i say that is there's an awful lot of people who go to gun shows,1,0
sw3518B-ms98-a,16,B,107.291625,118.48725,11.195625,and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun if that five day waiting period were in effect that you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show,1,0
sw3518B-ms98-a,22,B,156.04,160.7325,4.6925,well do you think that there will continue to always be crazies,1,0
sw3518B-ms98-a,49,B,284.99825,287.9915,2.99325,oh you can't no i- it should not be concealed,1,0
sw3518B-ms98-a,50,B,287.9915,292.318125,4.326625,it has to be on the hip  has to be in sight so that uh,2,0
sw3519A-ms98-a,16,A,67.491375,72.69425,5.202875,yeah it can be it can be very detailed and if you're playing with someone that is really serious i mean you can't,2,0
sw3519A-ms98-a,19,A,83.5085,94.864,11.3555, yeah well what's funny is we started out that it used to be that we started playing at seven thirty and we played till midnight and we played bridge now we get together and we finally start bridge about eight or eight thirty,1,0
sw3519A-ms98-a,21,A,101.160125,108.20775,7.047625, well it shows our age we have to be home by    ,1,0
sw3519B-ms98-a,80,B,277.404375,283.72375,6.319375,oh because_1 they think with vocab- with hobbies there's going to be a certain vocabulary u- i see,1,0
sw3520B-ms98-a,16,B,91.487,95.01975,3.53275,well that may be true too i hadn't thought of that,1,0
sw3520B-ms98-a,30,B,152.660125,167.585875,14.92575,so that it it would just be made available to everyone now other areas that i've worked in like in the chambers they would just have the candidates come and it would just you know that was not a l- lot of community involvement and those were people that would mostly vote anyway,1,0
sw3520B-ms98-a,54,B,247.154375,253.4825,6.328125,who happens to say the right thing at the right time who n- not it who may not be,1,0
sw3521A-ms98-a,63,A,270.68325,278.36375,7.6805,um  i wish it were in more depth um that doesn't mean to say longer just more facts would be nice,1,0
sw3521B-ms98-a,38,B,185.193375,192.158,6.964625,right right  not something you'll you'll uh be interested in ten years from now by any means,1,0
sw3523A-ms98-a,34,A,163.468,166.29675,2.82875,that'd be kind of  ,1,0
sw3523A-ms98-a,61,A,262.50625,266.061,3.55475,that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and ,1,0
sw3523A-ms98-a,63,A,269.940375,273.173375,3.233,it'd be kind of exciting in some ways to,1,0
sw3523A-ms98-a,64,A,273.173375,277.0565,3.883125,to see a little bit more of that and some ways it might be kind of ,1,0
sw3523A-ms98-a,72,A,298.501875,299.778,1.276125,would be nice though,1,0

sw3527A-ms98-a,17,A,60.7975,74.646875,13.849375,which i hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and because_1 like we have a dog and and you know he's gonna be out in the yard and who knows what he eats out there but we try not to use them_1 but we end up using some anyway,1,0
sw3528A-ms98-a,41,A,154.0215,159.528125,5.506625,you never think about that do you i would think it'd be harder to get up than it would be get back down,2,0
sw3528B-ms98-a,11,B,31.491625,42.715875,11.22425,well  uh  i'm not sure to be honest with you so uh this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure and uh,2,0
sw3528B-ms98-a,55,B,277.234125,286.21125,8.977125, uh i think they have cut it back to be honest with you from from the glory days when they  did the Apollo shots and the moon uh,1,0
sw3529A-ms98-a,15,A,71.90225,79.705375,7.803125,even that at that young i said it this is an Academy Award performance it has to be you you know and as it turned out she did win it that year ,1,0
sw3529A-ms98-a,36,A,194.429875,203.030125,8.60025,you know i'm i'll be honest with you it takes a fair amount to offend me  and sometimes i go to these movies and they've got just this gratuitous uh uh ,1,0
sw3529A-ms98-a,44,A,245.522875,251.33325,5.810375,i didn't think it was just the end all and be all like the Academy thought th- you know,1,0
sw3529A-ms98-a,54,A,291.42575,297.634,6.20825,i'm partially immune to it but it didn't  excuse me it didn't seem to be,1,0
sw3529B-ms98-a,52,B,231.46775,238.69125,7.2235,yeah well they could leave out a lot of that stuff and the movie would be just as good,1,0
sw3530B-ms98-a,73,B,254.943875,267.551625,12.60775,well it's it's one that you know it's it's always gonna make you have a good cry and you  it's gonna turn out good and you're gonna be happy in the ,1,0
sw3531A-ms98-a,4,A,18.81175,25.773125,6.961375,i think they said by the year two thousand there'll be at least five is it five thousand a year or more,1,0
sw3531A-ms98-a,5,A,25.773125,36.835,11.061875,uh yeah will be dying from it and i know uh what is it uh over in Africa it's just  already in horrendous uh,1,0
sw3531A-ms98-a,21,A,150.82875,162.79875,11.97,that came out and said that you know it would not be receiving this much publicity if it wasn't for someone like Magic Johnson and it would be you know very interesting to see,2,0
sw3531B-ms98-a,35,B,190.520375,197.566125,7.04575,i agree with you i do believe that there should be a greater amount of uh funding sources set aside for it but i,1,0
sw3531B-ms98-a,41,B,242.474375,248.089875,5.6155,that may be the other issue that it's it's it's reaching epidemic proportions and we have,1,0
sw3531B-ms98-a,47,B,261.744,265.039,3.295,yes and i don't know that it may not be,1,0
sw3532A-ms98-a,10,A,37.025875,49.31675,12.290875,really i'd be at a a little loss for words on this as far as i'm concerned most definitely uh most important benefit today would be hospitalization and of course retirement and things like that,2,0
sw3532A-ms98-a,46,A,267.1525,274.740875,7.588375,we're gonna retire in a couple of years and she'll uh she'll qualify for a little something after ten years of teaching but not a whole lot but it'll be,1,0
sw3532A-ms98-a,47,A,274.740875,277.086625,2.34575,certainly be useful and needed,1,0
sw3532B-ms98-a,45,B,204.88825,214.6415,9.75325,it helps you know pay the rent and or the mortgage and they and the car payments when uh that person has to be off with something like cancer or heart attack,1,0
sw3533A-ms98-a,2,A,0.059875,6.364625,6.30475,okay Miss Nancy we should be in business now did you hear the questions that the lady uh brought up ,1,0
sw3533A-ms98-a,50,A,238.048,245.4115,7.3635,that's great there was a ques- the question now to ask is it difficult to find time and you seem to be making out all right,1,0
sw3533B-ms98-a,47,B,232.462875,238.264125,5.80125,i go to the kitchen and cook and my sister and and her husband are coming down so there's gonna be eleven of us,1,0
sw3534A-ms98-a,64,A,220.1215,223.092375,2.970875,it wouldn't be Thanksgiving dinner without the turkey,1,0
sw3534B-ms98-a,51,B,171.026875,175.617375,4.5905,in fact turkey uh would be my choice of meal anytime i,1,0
sw3534B-ms98-a,60,B,210.159125,214.269625,4.1105, the mood i don't know what uh Thanksgiving or Christmas would be without,1,0
sw3535A-ms98-a,31,A,170.53725,182.41325,11.876,i don't i don't either uh to make it totally honest uh i think there's a- there's always gonna be some way somebody can cut a corner uh however,1,0
sw3535A-ms98-a,34,A,194.313625,206.26275,11.949125,right right i think that uh Reagan and Bush were up to their necks in that Iran Contra thing and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that but uh,1,0
sw3535A-ms98-a,43,A,240.18525,249.006875,8.821625,right and this'd be for the best for the nation overall  you're right it's just a i don't know i guess that's where they stay in uh,1,0
sw3535B-ms98-a,11,B,28.91725,36.52425,7.607, oh  let's see we're on government whether we think it's honest  or can be,1,0
sw3535B-ms98-a,30,B,162.870875,170.674,7.803125,uh that that's small scale i don't know you know i really don't know what could be done,1,0
sw3536A-ms98-a,33,A,141.883125,152.7325,10.849375,and when i go to visit my brother and sister-in-law in Austin it drives me crazy because i- i always have to be sure and put something in my suitcase to read because honestly i wonder these people don't ever read,1,0
sw3536B-ms98-a,33,B,123.38375,129.894875,6.511125, yeah  we get the newspaper on the weekends and that seems to be enough ,1,0
sw3537A-ms98-a,31,A,237.230375,250.0275,12.797125,well i think that should be tha- that's a another problem but that's part of our legalese problem and that the government eventually will   just you know because_1 it's out of control i- i agree with you,1,0
sw3537A-ms98-a,32,A,250.0275,261.978,11.9505,you know uh i was on a jury or i- i didn't make the jury but there was a deal where a doctor was gonna be sued for malpractice on the death of an infant,1,0
sw3537A-ms98-a,35,A,283.293,293.70125,10.40825,uh you know if the doctor is wrong you know it he should be pulled from his license but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it,1,0
sw3537B-ms98-a,22,B,229.498,237.447375,7.949375,how litigious our society is if the doctor makes a mistake he can be sure that he's gonna to be hauled into court,2,0
sw3538A-ms98-a,37,A,107.095375,111.88575,4.790375, all right do you do you think they they should be paid that much,1,0

sw3538B-ms98-a,23,B,89.765875,94.054625,4.28875,they're probably th- th- they may be another year away from going all the way,1,0
sw3538B-ms98-a,24,B,94.054625,97.389625,3.335,but they'll they'll be in the play-offs and i think they'll do real good ,1,0
sw3538B-ms98-a,36,B,153.183625,157.631875,4.44825,because_1 i don't want to hold them_1 back from trying anything i mean they may be may be good at it,2,0
sw3539B-ms98-a,27,B,143.973125,151.03175,7.058625,uh rec centers really where they offer aerobics and i've done that before but it always had to be late at night,1,0
sw3539B-ms98-a,58,B,294.08175,299.17,5.08825,but he decided that uh maybe you know uh if i wa- you know would be willing to wa-,1,0
sw3540A-ms98-a,40,A,150.7,153.49925,2.79925,yeah   it would be ,1,0
sw3540A-ms98-a,82,A,270.873,281.388125,10.515125,weather is beautiful down here real nice real nice it got up to about seventy five degrees down here and that's kind of the right temperature to be painting things but,1,0
sw3540B-ms98-a,15,B,57.429,61.499375,4.070375,that's probably have to be converted to a bedroom so,1,0
sw3540B-ms98-a,62,B,242.159875,254.750625,12.59075,it was a latex we had a kind of hard time getting it thin enough be- latex is kind of rubbery to begin with a little thicker than most but it ended up working fine plus i was the weather you know i did it in uh ,1,0
sw3541A-ms98-a,25,A,97.0645,104.390125,7.325625,uh as far as ability to pay which a- allegedly allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards,1,0
sw3541A-ms98-a,29,A,117.065125,123.771375,6.70625,you know two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they aren't going to be paying taxes on you know,1,0
sw3541A-ms98-a,47,A,184.694,193.472625,8.778625,prerogative you know  i- i- i don't have a whole lot of    y- you maybe you buy that you know and i don't mean to be knocking uh ,1,0
sw3541A-ms98-a,55,A,248.152375,261.862,13.709625,said that all you know if they gave back the ah deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be you know spending more money using their credit cards,1,0
sw3542A-ms98-a,9,A,47.14075,53.245625,6.104875,Americans are becoming a little more aware and uh are forcing our government to be uh on top of,1,0
sw3542B-ms98-a,25,B,102.168875,108.7745,6.605625,that that that needs to be changed and and they should have more accounting on the different ways that they,1,0
sw3542B-ms98-a,43,B,187.37175,194.845875,7.474125,and i was surprised by that because it had seemed to me like there was almost getting to be that it was hard to get people to run because of the reason that,1,0
sw3542B-ms98-a,46,B,205.677625,208.70525,3.027625,i think that would be a little bit frightening to,1,0
sw3542B-ms98-a,47,B,208.70525,214.782875,6.077625,to be put in the public eye like that myself but we've had it here in the state a lot of people that are going to run for,1,0
sw3542B-ms98-a,52,B,231.916,236.399,4.483,do you think the parties are a good thing or do you think they need to be done away with or,1,0
sw3543A-ms98-a,21,A,80.53175,86.58925,6.0575,well i kind of a- agree with terrorism i think those guys should be done away with that's,1,0
sw3543A-ms98-a,25,A,101.216,106.301375,5.085375,no it's got to be something that is gonna cost them_1 because_1 we never lock anybody up forever,1,0
sw3543A-ms98-a,46,A,208.9885,217.59025,8.60175,terrorism just a there's just like five things that i think they ought to be snuffed for but i'm i'm for it for certain reasons,1,0
sw3543A-ms98-a,51,A,234.515,236.769,2.254,it'd probably have to be a pattern,1,0
sw3543B-ms98-a,37,B,149.451125,156.670125,7.219,convicting people and and incarcerating them for a long time if that could be improved upon that would have more impact i think,1,0
sw3543B-ms98-a,40,B,168.297,175.848625,7.551625,um because that one at least you might escape from because his victim you know his witnesses will be gone,1,0
sw3544A-ms98-a,8,A,27.450875,31.870125,4.41925,well i know and uh time seems to be such a element nowadays,1,0
sw3544A-ms98-a,11,A,34.11125,38.76325,4.652, and the house has to be clean that's the worse part to me ,1,0
sw3544A-ms98-a,46,A,166.0935,175.00225,8.90875,i think it must be good because_1 i have an Italian neighbor down the street that bought some for company i thought golly she sh- she cooks a lot too and i if she bought it it must be pretty  ,2,0
sw3544B-ms98-a,4,B,4.43675,8.489375,4.052625,oh that was a would be difficult yeah i had one on immigration,1,0
sw3544B-ms98-a,11,B,30.25825,34.996375,4.738125,exactly you've got to get things that it can be done ahead or,1,0
sw3544B-ms98-a,13,B,36.634375,43.15475,6.520375,yeah that way i have to get my husband to help me with that because_1 i'd never never be able to entertain otherwise,1,0
sw3544B-ms98-a,26,B,84.8305,88.9885,4.158,exactly i like to be able to entertain and not be killing myself while,2,0
sw3544B-ms98-a,38,B,122.412,125.743375,3.331375,so you'd think it would be easy but it's actually you know quite a bit of work,1,0
sw3545A-ms98-a,11,A,34.813875,44.282125,9.46825,no and i clocked it and it was only nine miles from the office and of course didn't think that would be bad uh but the only time i ever drove it was not during rush hour,1,0
sw3546A-ms98-a,40,A,139.7855,142.507125,2.721625,right may be,1,0
sw3546A-ms98-a,71,A,289.691625,297.538,7.846375,right we got a lot of the effects from that that and that's hard to believe isn't it you wouldn't you wouldn't think we could even be remo-,1,0
sw3546B-ms98-a,31,B,165.244125,170.7985,5.554375,well i did i would like to have one too but i yeah i- i think it'd be great,1,0
sw3546B-ms98-a,37,B,203.41225,217.426375,14.014125,yeah and h- right and here we be get cold and we may be cold for a week you know down in the twenties and teens and then it's back up to the forties and fifties yeah so it's it's ,2,0
sw3547A-ms98-a,9,A,24.626,27.5265,2.9005,i would guess i would be sort of pro,1,0
sw3547A-ms98-a,22,A,81.822,90.75825,8.93625,stand that should be taken and i think that dealers now or to buy a gun now an individual just has to go in a store and and show his drivers license and if he,1,0
sw3547A-ms98-a,24,A,100.674,107.161,6.487,right it would be it would be handy if they had you know computers being like they are if they'd have some kind of a,2,0
sw3547A-ms98-a,27,A,113.99325,116.579625,2.586375,i would be for something like that,1,0
sw3547A-ms98-a,44,A,245.861,256.2825,10.4215,just as you say some people don't think of them as that but that's how i think of them_1 being that i'm in the business but main thing is just be education and communication on the subject,1,0
sw3547B-ms98-a,41,B,192.97775,203.113,10.13525,she knew that the gun that i had was not to be touched and that it was dangerous and i never had to worry about her,1,0
sw3548B-ms98-a,36,B,150.06375,153.3715,3.30775, well this isn't my favorite well i'll be honest with you,1,0
sw3548B-ms98-a,45,B,180.061875,184.918625,4.85675, yeah i kind of think she will be {alrighty} bye now,1,0
sw3550B-ms98-a,5,B,5.57925,12.92075,7.3415,the question is i mean would i want to buy or would i would i probably actually  may be two different things,1,0
sw3550B-ms98-a,82,B,258.99125,266.812,7.82075,and so uh i bought a used Yugo just to be a little you know a little car that i could care less about just waste yeah,1,0
sw3551A-ms98-a,15,A,61.63825,69.008375,7.370125, yeah it Plano's uh improved greatly in the last twenty twenty five years that's for sure it used to be the pits,1,0
sw3551A-ms98-a,25,A,117.660375,125.963125,8.30275,i mean what they'd be teaching in an Arlington school they might not be teaching in a Plano school and and the very same,2,0
sw3551A-ms98-a,34,A,171.44625,181.5735,10.12725,at this point and uh you know where our kids might be in a great school we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read you know,1,0
sw3551B-ms98-a,51,B,182.023875,187.365875,5.342,but do you think that there should be um nationwide um curriculum,1,0
sw3551B-ms98-a,60,B,237.535125,239.833375,2.29825,who do you think it should be done through,1,0
sw3552B-ms98-a,51,B,287.98325,292.294375,4.311125,well there has to be some talent there there has to be some voice,2,0
sw3553A-ms98-a,81,A,248.726125,254.3125,5.586375,oh boy i it is i i don't know a nursing home seems to be such a,1,0
sw3553B-ms98-a,19,B,80.86975,86.401875,5.532125,and uh she realized that it was something that had to be done,1,0
sw3554A-ms98-a,47,A,220.861375,223.843875,2.9825,i do i have to be real careful,1,0
sw3554B-ms98-a,33,B,120.480375,131.449375,10.969, so i got my weight down and  it's kind of easy for me to  to forget about it now because uh you know when i'm not fat like i used to be uh you know i just don't worry about it you know,1,0
sw3555A-ms98-a,25,A,111.249375,115.691375,4.442,and uh there might be a big void there and i uh it's certainly a,1,0
sw3555B-ms98-a,35,B,121.880875,126.356625,4.47575,yeah  well it's gonna be interesting see what happens the next year there,1,0
sw3555B-ms98-a,48,B,177.348,183.640625,6.292625,seems like that'd be something that be so controversial that it pretty well exclude himself from any political office,2,0
sw3556A-ms98-a,14,A,70.377375,75.962125,5.58475,so but i would just as soon uh be doing something else it's just that,1,0
sw3556A-ms98-a,48,A,202.5635,210.147375,7.583875,little things that disturb me and i know he's being a little hard-nosed about it but uh you know this ring of honor thing you know he needs to be there,1,0
sw3556A-ms98-a,50,A,217.935125,219.8175,1.882375,he needs to be remembered,1,0
sw3556A-ms98-a,52,A,221.184125,227.756,6.571875,no no no a- absolutely not   that's true but he needs to be honored put it that way ,1,0
sw3556A-ms98-a,64,A,261.0165,271.915625,10.899125,it's been a great place to raise our kids and i've got my last kid graduating from college this next December she's getting married the month before in November so i will have finished be finished  with that,1,0
sw3556B-ms98-a,47,B,183.3435,193.562,10.2185,because_1 he's too he's too far he's far too much of a gentleman and a and a practicing Christian to uh to ever be thought of as anything but a lose- you know but a winner,1,0
sw3557A-ms98-a,4,A,11.768,17.095875,5.327875,many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer i think it'll probably be as difficult,1,0
sw3557A-ms98-a,16,A,66.103125,73.878,7.774875,uh i've just heard it on the radio sometimes you hear things that on the radio that  you know could be true or couldn't be,2,0
sw3557B-ms98-a,29,B,113.8875,120.61375,6.72625,i think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general,1,0
sw3558A-ms98-a,15,A,82.917375,85.627375,2.71,yes yes that's supposed to be really pretty,1,0
sw3558A-ms98-a,37,A,200.020375,203.494375,3.474,well it'd probably be better in the summer time when it's warm,1,0
sw3558B-ms98-a,40,B,158.527,164.0385,5.5115,yeah i think that would be a neat place to visit because_1 i had a cousin who went to school at,1,0
sw3558B-ms98-a,63,B,261.089,267.42225,6.33325, no we didn't have time but that we've seen pictures of it i think that'd be nice to go there ,1,0
sw3560A-ms98-a,68,A,245.343875,249.309,3.965125,where as if you're paying millions of dollars for it i think you'd be a little more ,1,0
sw3560B-ms98-a,20,B,68.128625,73.690625,5.562,they had a a c- a cat there an- turned out to be ah an older cat about two years old,1,0
sw3560B-ms98-a,55,B,223.51125,233.84275,10.3315,i think probably i'd be ha- happier with just a ordinary mutt you know you get a dog that's uh show quality and you know you got to be real careful with it and,2,0
sw3560B-ms98-a,61,B,249.0235,258.013125,8.989625,yeah that that you know i don't wanna get into a thing where you take him to shows and and you know all these papers and stuff and you got to be careful and all this and that,1,0
sw3561A-ms98-a,2,A,1.306,4.469375,3.163375,i mean short term i don't think anything's gonna be done about it,1,0
sw3561A-ms98-a,3,A,4.469375,6.29975,1.830375,or probably should be done about it,1,0
sw3561A-ms98-a,9,A,33.169625,35.064,1.894375,and that's got to be paid,1,0
sw3561A-ms98-a,31,A,189.969875,196.802125,6.83225, and the longer well can be done or will be done are two different things um,2,0
sw3561A-ms98-a,34,A,207.703,219.989875,12.286875,but there are various other areas such as as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed ah a lot of entitlement programs like education aid i think ah,1,0
sw3561B-ms98-a,5,B,5.6835,9.971875,4.288375,uh are you saying you didn't think anything should be done in the short term,1,0
sw3561B-ms98-a,13,B,34.308625,45.189,10.880375,exactly and and uh so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come um i'm not really,1,0
sw3561B-ms98-a,15,B,55.9695,68.848375,12.878875,uh the tax that needs to be paid or the t- taxes currently being paid then that can't it seems to me it can't possibly  you know help with the the deficit picture,1,0
sw3561B-ms98-a,22,B,103.073375,114.481125,11.40775,if people have to pay less money in taxes they'll have more money to spend uh and if they have more money to spend then that will be a a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity,1,0
sw3561B-ms98-a,39,B,186.95075,192.383125,5.432375, i don't know what kind of things do you think can be done in in uh in the long term,1,0
sw3561B-ms98-a,46,B,249.897125,258.557125,8.66,situation and i think certain entitlements i i'm inclined to agree with you too education happens to be one place where i think that we would be foolish to um uh ,2,0
sw3562A-ms98-a,3,A,1.633375,16.15175,14.518375,well i feel that women have in the roles that they've played they've uh they used to be at home all the time with the children and now most of them work out of the home because it takes two incomes to make it,1,0
sw3562A-ms98-a,40,A,180.466375,186.618875,6.1525,well that may be a thing for the future the computers now that they're they're trying to stress that for women to ,1,0
sw3562B-ms98-a,6,B,28.022,37.754875,9.732875,sure uh unfortunately what that's done is it's put everybody in a terrible position because it used to be that one person could work whether it a man or a woman ,1,0
sw3562B-ms98-a,32,B,165.52825,169.0115,3.48325,not be home pay for a babysitter or day care,1,0
sw3562B-ms98-a,48,B,211.682375,224.48275,12.800375,no i i i've known a few people and i've read uh about others you know just like articles and stuff about other people doing it i certainly would do it uh i have no problem with that unfortunately i'm paid a lot more than my wife so it wouldn't be worth it,1,0
sw3562B-ms98-a,56,B,258.184125,271.999,13.814875,you know like i like i think it's hard but i mean a lot of times women were given jobs because they were women you know and i think once once it evens out so that women get the jobs that they deserve and get the pay that they deserve which will often be,1,0
sw3562B-ms98-a,57,B,271.999,278.113625,6.114625,powerful positions where there will be less discrimination in hiring when they hopefully when they hire,1,0
sw3562B-ms98-a,65,B,295.778,298.754,2.976,why would it be fair earlier i mean you know,1,0
sw3563A-ms98-a,7,A,43.34275,54.37475,11.032,they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possi- be a a final a final team playing for for all of it national championship or the world championship and something like this happens,1,0
sw3563A-ms98-a,10,A,67.183125,72.949125,5.766,that probably would be evident with the more and more the more and more young guys they draft,1,0
sw3563A-ms98-a,35,A,246.82325,258.3805,11.55725,there's an old saying you can l- you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink so and i think Tarpley's just a sad case but to be making ah a million dollars a year that's pretty sad,1,0
sw3564A-ms98-a,28,A,115.100625,122.159875,7.05925,below of that eighty two or eighty three degrees at night and then over a hundred every day and that got to be awfully oppressive,1,0

sw3571A-ms98-a,78,A,236.495875,239.239375,2.7435,yeah it would be nice,1,0

sw3572A-ms98-a,2,A,0.678375,8.201875,7.5235,well seems to me that part of the problem with public education may just be the wide disparity in what's being offered i don't know what you've experienced,1,0

sw3573A-ms98-a,40,A,215.9555,228.615625,12.660125,so um yeah anyway i've been looking at the prices of these cars and a- and so forth and i think that it's it's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to,1,0
sw3573B-ms98-a,8,B,18.40325,30.233125,11.829875,and uh i'll be honest with you i have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and and uh put together and it it does its job,1,0

sw3577A-ms98-a,40,A,247.96725,250.644625,2.677375, yes things would be different ,1,0
sw3577B-ms98-a,16,B,86.507,93.292375,6.785375,oh yeah it's merging with uh something else from the south and gonna be First Southern or First National or something i don't know,1,0

sw3578B-ms98-a,31,B,153.40325,159.34625,5.943,uh probably living better in in jail than he would be if he was out on the streets or whatever you know because_1,1,0

sw3591A-ms98-a,29,A,201.0385,206.744,5.7055,and uh but yes i agree there's a lot of options there could be a lot of options,1,0
sw3591A-ms98-a,39,A,278.803875,286.242,7.438125,people are less trusting all these things tend to destroy this type of system but i agree with you it it might be some possibilities there,1,0

sw3604B-ms98-a,43,B,239.33925,249.542375,10.203125,uh the other people that have gotten into drugs i think they're going to be more conscious of the effect it can have and they get you know look at what he's thrown away,1,0

sw3607A-ms98-a,70,A,282.566,286.842125,4.276125,well that would that would be in terri- terribly exasperating to have the,1,0
sw3607B-ms98-a,13,B,59.256375,67.354875,8.0985,uh we did have a little bit of rain yesterday so far we haven't had any today and uh i suppose that means i should be uh,1,0
sw3607B-ms98-a,20,B,86.712625,100.125125,13.4125,no i uh as a matter of fact we've never had a leak actually yet now this we just bought the house last year and um uh just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles so ,1,0

sw3608B-ms98-a,7,B,38.25675,43.56175,5.305, yeah he may but it'll be interesting to see how this sort of loose commonwealth uh,1,0
sw3608B-ms98-a,8,B,43.56175,53.60275,10.041,works from the standpoint of uh being as one political entity or whether it's really just going to be kind of a loose confederation,1,0
sw3608B-ms98-a,13,B,87.892625,100.55375,12.661125,it may be interesting to see how when they start talking about border defense whether they're gonna i think most of those independent countries are going to decide that they want to defend their own borders,1,0
sw3608B-ms98-a,16,B,111.986375,124.47,12.483625,what Russia's going to bid for is the seat on the Security Council but i suppose that all of the other eleven can or the ten others or however many there are can be admitted as regular members of the UN,1,0

sw3610B-ms98-a,11,B,45.151625,55.3525,10.200875,that uh they should have the opportunity to do it and the quote homemaker's role should be divided equally between the partners,1,0

sw3611A-ms98-a,45,A,184.96475,196.822,11.85725,yeah and see that's i couldn't do it i think that that'd be super tough just because_1 the people that you learn to love you see dying off one by one and i think that would just be really i admire those who can i couldn't handle that personally,2,0
sw3611A-ms98-a,54,A,230.184625,235.671875,5.48725,i i really don't to be honest with you i'm just seen i've done some work in  homes and i've kind of,1,0
sw3611A-ms98-a,62,A,274.959875,280.100375,5.1405,and they know that they're still wanted and they're still they can still be a productive part of society,1,0
sw3611B-ms98-a,27,B,137.054375,151.782375,14.728,well it really is um  my dad can't even feed himself  and um he still you know health is pretty his mind pretty much and that's why we can't put him there i guess if he didn't have his mind you know it would be easier to do that,1,0
sw3612A-ms98-a,16,A,81.2315,88.333375,7.101875,so we'll have boys on the trip that'll they all should be twelve by the time we go all ranging all the way up to seventeen,1,0

sw3615A-ms98-a,62,A,213.502125,215.5575,2.055375,that'd be kind of fun,1,0
sw3615A-ms98-a,75,A,262.4905,273.97125,11.48075,whereas uh i'm the type of person i could not s- sit s- well i shouldn't say i could not but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something,1,0
sw3615B-ms98-a,40,B,187.977125,201.21625,13.239125, but you know but every now and then i mean he's got a lot of those technic- those hard kind you know and he wants to be an engineer so he still likes all that kind of building stuff and um we have the train and we haven't had that Lego train together for years,1,0
sw3616B-ms98-a,12,B,39.208875,53.810625,14.60175,pretty much an order pretty much i don't know it's kind of hard to describe i mean it's kind uh you have to kind of see it because it wasn't what i expected because i was thinking it's going to be just kind of a typical rundown of what you know you've heard the past you know ten years but um,1,0
sw3616B-ms98-a,38,B,143.61575,153.705375,10.089625,right it's about uh Bugsy Siegel who um pretty much started Flamingo out in Vegas he had like the vision of you know Vegas what it could be what it is today ,1,0
sw3616B-ms98-a,45,B,178.731,188.2,9.469,right and you know the the great thing is you know his six million dollar investment turned out to be a two hundred billion dollar return so,1,0
sw3618A-ms98-a,42,A,162.258375,167.924875,5.6665,well the one that i that i we would put my mother in would be about three miles from my home,1,0
sw3618A-ms98-a,46,A,177.644625,185.92975,8.285125,it is it is and you just you know well it comes right down to it i think it'd be heartbreaking how old was your grandmother when you put her in,1,0
sw3618B-ms98-a,32,B,157.199375,162.537375,5.338,be you know be able to check up on them_1 on a weekly basis just to make sure that they were treating them_1 properly,2,0
sw3618B-ms98-a,34,B,167.339,168.990375,1.651375,oh that wouldn't be too bad,1,0
sw3619A-ms98-a,87,A,285.50625,293.7775,8.27125, it might deter them well they say that that deters a lot a lot of would be you know burglaries,1,0
sw3619B-ms98-a,10,B,25.224875,34.674,9.449125,oh yeah it just keeps going higher and higher we're going to have a we're going to set a record for us but possibly will be the  place to live in the nation,1,0
sw3620A-ms98-a,10,A,38.0805,43.1585,5.078,it seem to be mutating just like about_1 about like the common cold,1,0
sw3620A-ms98-a,11,A,43.1585,47.93875,4.78025,finding a cure for something like that could be,1,0
sw3620A-ms98-a,31,A,121.743625,133.414125,11.6705,the uh funding situation seems to be the same f- for so many of the major diseases so to speak the uh bulk of the money goes to administrative costs,1,0
sw3620A-ms98-a,36,A,166.559375,172.349,5.789625,they figured well you know we all want to be promiscuous so go running all over the place and,1,0
sw3620A-ms98-a,56,A,280.483,289.06775,8.58475,course then again most of the people who are protesting the cut in the budget would probably be just as upset if they raised the tax city taxes to cover the costs,1,0
sw3621A-ms98-a,14,A,60.49775,73.13125,12.6335,oh absolut- i think you know like you said a lot of it there's a lot things for example i go to school out in Utah and my family lives here in Texas and so it's kind of like you said uh i never realized what an expense it would be trying to come home and ,1,0
sw3621A-ms98-a,18,A,81.92425,91.652625,9.728375,yeah it is and i think to there's there's a lot of times like you said that's one of the major considerations is you know how much do you want to be with your family or how much do you wanna,1,0

sw3642B-ms98-a,8,B,85.5965,94.799125,9.202625,you know just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing but i think that ultimately it would be,1,0

sw3644A-ms98-a,33,A,119.366125,122.2945,2.928375,the death penalty should be available almost any,1,0
sw3644A-ms98-a,37,A,130.62475,135.479125,4.854375,it should be at least available as punishment for rape,1,0
sw3644A-ms98-a,39,A,137.5735,148.33775,10.76425,i think if it was a serious possibility of being executed for doing any of the major crimes that it would be a little less likely for people to commit them ,1,0

sw3644A-ms98-a,48,A,193.244,198.350875,5.106875,that ought to be considered murder and potential death penalty,1,0

sw3644B-ms98-a,12,B,49.11675,59.93425,10.8175,i oh seventeen years i think and they just keep retrying and retrying and i just it's just a waste of taxpayers' money and and i really think it would be a deterrent,1,0
sw3644B-ms98-a,24,B,129.6915,131.82575,2.13425, they be-,1,0
sw3644B-ms98-a,30,B,161.21,168.369125,7.159125,and i definitely think that that should be a death penalty and they get less than than people that ha- are murdered,1,0

sw3645A-ms98-a,13,A,155.536375,170.095125,14.55875,well i think you're right i think trend in reading i think one reason that the Times Herald folded and other papers folded is the people are reading newspapers less than they used to and i guess that means they must be reading magazines and you know other written stuff less too,1,0
sw3645A-ms98-a,22,A,229.1605,237.575875,8.415375,that may be it and with desktop publishing and stuff i think a lot more magazines that are that aim just smaller market will be coming out,2,0

sw3645B-ms98-a,38,B,202.567375,212.156625,9.58925,that could be that could be because there's not there's not really an alternative uh  uh source for that kind of kind of information but uh,2,0
sw3645B-ms98-a,55,B,281.218875,291.604375,10.3855,moving away from paper magazines uh i guess would it be included in that in terms of of uh computer access and stuff but that that,1,0
sw3646A-ms98-a,26,A,128.0495,140.346,12.2965, can really get away with murder and the teachers don't have as much aren't respected as much and uh they have to be some careful of the things they do and say,1,0
sw3646A-ms98-a,49,A,243.092125,254.593875,11.50175,well it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi's we used to have to wear dresses and then you had to uh go to dresses they had to be a pantsuit and it was polyester and it had to be matching and,2,0
sw3646B-ms98-a,7,B,24.671875,29.921625,5.24975, well i had one that was needed to be able to be moved along,2,0
sw3646B-ms98-a,8,B,29.921625,41.461625,11.54,at a at a pace a little faster than he was gonna be able to m- be moved in public school so  he's he has been going to private since kindergarten  so,2,0
sw3646B-ms98-a,14,B,76.2195,81.201625,4.982125,yeah that was  we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture and,1,0
sw3646B-ms98-a,19,B,99.64925,110.31275,10.6635,and i just didn't think that was gonna get it i thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead uh everyday,1,0
sw3646B-ms98-a,20,B,110.31275,114.1475,3.83475,but yet still be with his peers age wise,1,0
sw3646B-ms98-a,28,B,173.119125,186.4065,13.287375, yeah but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for elders and adults particularly in in responsible positions  have not uh,1,0
sw3646B-ms98-a,32,B,203.184875,211.9025,8.717625,well the world changes so i mean obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be i mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things they have a whole lot more,1,0
sw3647A-ms98-a,39,A,135.427375,145.13725,9.709875,and that got to be somewhat expensive and so i- i think one of the benefits i- i see is the uh is the group uh group discount,1,0
sw3648A-ms98-a,8,A,33.002,38.921375,5.919375,um personal opinion there's a whole lot of weapons available on the market that really shouldn't be available at all,1,0
sw3648A-ms98-a,53,A,203.366,206.525375,3.159375,yeah probably ought to be longer than that really,1,0
sw3648A-ms98-a,62,A,240.705625,247.3825,6.676875,you ought a ought to be required to keep it in your billfold at all times whether you got your gun with you or not like a driver's license,1,0
sw3648A-ms98-a,70,A,294.965875,298.722,3.756125,hm later on in the season it gets to be less of a problem espec-,1,0
sw3648B-ms98-a,64,B,246.904125,254.54725,7.643125,you should have a a a permit to use it and a uh be trained on how to use it,1,0
sw3649B-ms98-a,5,B,14.426375,21.870375,7.444,and i i think its just because it was  i seem to always be bad weather and i'm just going over the ,1,0
sw3650A-ms98-a,15,A,51.9845,55.824125,3.839625, i i personally think it would be a a good idea,1,0
sw3650A-ms98-a,37,A,157.210625,161.7075,4.496875,well i think it would be a good idea is a it is kind of a delicate time but,1,0
sw3650B-ms98-a,9,B,46.116125,51.607125,5.491,get uh some kind of more awareness about the world and be of some use for a while,1,0
sw3650B-ms98-a,20,B,116.175,126.866875,10.691875,which is a similar program although you stay within the US which can be very beneficial too i mean a lot of times there's a lot of help we can do within the US um and that,1,0
sw3650B-ms98-a,28,B,172.48775,176.690875,4.203125,yeah i think it would be extremely beneficial to just about everybody,1,0
sw3650B-ms98-a,29,B,176.690875,185.32525,8.634375,um i i could see that there'd be some people that you know would throw up their arms about it and go i'm going to Harvard and       i wanna do but,1,0
sw3650B-ms98-a,41,B,267.50075,279.864,12.36325,um  a more one on one idea of there can be a different life than what they've had and it to uh experience some things that otherwise they wouldn't be able to get out and do,2,0
sw3651A-ms98-a,12,A,69.122125,80.353875,11.23175,well i'll have to     that sounds like a good idea i you know and that's that is right it is out of necessity because a lot of the things that uh well we can't be able to afford,1,0
sw3651A-ms98-a,14,A,89.133,96.85375,7.72075,and uh sounds like you got some real nice tools too do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools,1,0
sw3651A-ms98-a,40,A,195.8575,203.64325,7.78575,well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldn't be able to do that,1,0
sw3652A-ms98-a,10,A,53.023375,60.1705,7.147125,yeah i don't think there'd be any problem there the only question is would the rest of the country be interested in watching two Texas teams slug it out,2,0
sw3652A-ms98-a,20,A,104.5895,117.693125,13.103625,you know if he's got a contract that pays him regardless of injuries he's in good shape well you know that Michael Irvin's going to get a big boost and already uh Jones has said that uh they anticipate that he'll be giving Michael Irvin a big pay raise,1,0
sw3652A-ms98-a,21,A,117.693125,120.326875,2.63375,so i think that'll be coming,1,0
sw3652A-ms98-a,23,A,135.442375,148.210375,12.768,well his problem is that he since he doesn't seem as mobile as some of the other quarterbacks he seems to get one bad injury every year so Beuerlein or someone like Beuerlein is going to be a necessity while Aikman's around,1,0
sw3652A-ms98-a,26,A,159.920625,165.821,5.900375,well i i really think Buffalo wi- will win the game i'll be surprised if Kansas City wins it,1,0
sw3652A-ms98-a,27,A,165.821,176.628875,10.807875,but uh Houston Denver um that one might be more even than than people would otherwise think i don't think that one's gonna be uh blow out for anybody it might be a pretty close game,3,0
sw3652A-ms98-a,33,A,216.372625,230.106625,13.734,some of those guys'll be pros there's one fellow plays for my wife's school East Carolina named uh Jeff Blake and he's gonna  almost surely be drafted by the pros he had an incredible day yesterday,2,0
sw3652B-ms98-a,12,B,48.010375,53.504,5.493625,well uh that would be an interesting game i think that game would be sold out what do you think,2,0
sw3652B-ms98-a,26,B,119.5015,125.135125,5.633625,sure i think it will be too and i think Steve Beuerlein might get a little raise too he's uh,1,0
sw3652B-ms98-a,27,B,125.135125,136.2355,11.100375,um Troy Aikman i wonder even though he's a real good player i wonder if he's going to be able to uh stand the physical abuse that the NFL offers he might not make it,1,0
sw3652B-ms98-a,29,B,148.7115,155.734125,7.022625,yep so what do you think about uh the games that's going to be played uh tomorrow Buffalo and,1,0
sw3653A-ms98-a,44,A,148.627,160.81875,12.19175,so that's i was kind of i my preference would to be just to go to a bigger car i think rather than rather than a van but you know even that is it's hard to find a car that is big enough i guess,1,0
sw3653A-ms98-a,45,A,160.81875,169.6565,8.83775,the problem we have now is our car it doesn't have a bench seat up front so if we had the bench seat then we would be fine but when we bought it we ,1,0
sw3653B-ms98-a,13,B,55.794125,63.82075,8.026625,hum-um yeah you would think it'd be a lot worse i know mini vans don't get much better than that they get about twenty one twenty two,1,0
sw3653B-ms98-a,50,B,171.298125,175.823875,4.52575,yeah well i don't know if you'd be h- how old is your oldest,1,0
sw3653B-ms98-a,51,B,175.823875,180.823,4.999125,eight yeah see i- i don't know how long you'd be happy like that,1,0
sw3653B-ms98-a,52,B,180.823,189.197375,8.374375,well i don't know how often all all six of you all will be in the car but i know that once you get one or two car seats in there,1,0
sw3654A-ms98-a,7,A,23.20225,27.995125,4.792875,i don't think so either and i think that every gun should be covered cover covered,1,0
sw3654A-ms98-a,24,A,86.693625,98.6315,11.937875,well i i think that every gun should be covered from rifles and the automatics and and handguns because people need if they're out after a gun they need a cooling off period,1,0
sw3654A-ms98-a,59,A,231.892625,237.62025,5.727625,no that's what i think that it should be is registration and guns that can be traced,2,0
sw3654A-ms98-a,68,A,253.391,264.141375,10.750375,uh-huh well i'm about an eight on that i think that uh that we need gun control but you know so many laws would be uh necessary if we'd just use common sense,1,0
sw3654B-ms98-a,5,B,16.222,24.0395,7.8175,uh i think the right of ownership needs to be protected but i don't think there's too much wrong with having it registered and having you think about it a little bit,1,0
sw3654B-ms98-a,35,B,139.410375,142.454,3.043625, it must be seventy five degrees out there,1,0
sw3654B-ms98-a,53,B,206.493125,221.266,14.772875,in Texas it's not against the law let's see what i say i said it would be all right legally if i put on a a side gun and walked down the street with a gun strapped on my side it's clear view and you couldn't arrest me he said yes i can arrest you i said what for he said breaking the peace i said who's peace am a bothering he said mine i'm the cop,1,0
sw3654B-ms98-a,65,B,276.722875,285.737625,9.01475,i'll be there's a law in Texas says you can't have them in bar i think it would be a lot more sense if they say please check them at the front door because i know people are in there with them on,2,0
sw3655A-ms98-a,38,A,169.30125,174.635625,5.334375,oh yeah i think it would be hard to take them to people you don't know,1,0
sw3655A-ms98-a,65,A,285.4145,297.513125,12.098625,i think i just think it would be hard to do that full time i feel such a responsibility even when we go out for a few hours that are they driving the babysitter crazy and,1,0
sw3656A-ms98-a,48,A,256.9635,267.789125,10.825625,anyway if th- if the criminals a- do not come around here i'm going to be extremely fortunate um-hum,1,0
sw3656B-ms98-a,7,B,15.701875,26.638,10.936125,and on New Year's Eve you know how it's supposed to be bringing in the new year and everything the with the neighborhood we have around here it was automatic gunfire going off instead of fire works,1,0
sw3657A-ms98-a,41,A,173.182375,175.1645,1.982125,well that's great be-,1,0
sw3657B-ms98-a,9,B,100.725,104.8215,4.0965,and uh i now am learning to be a sys admin,1,0
sw3657B-ms98-a,17,B,149.708,155.8655,6.1575,no no learning i'm learning to i'm learning to be uh one who knows what's he's doing,1,0
sw3658A-ms98-a,40,A,202.14375,211.988625,9.844875,so um i'm really quite active in trying to uh uh be proactive at least to for children's issues it's very complex very complicated but,1,0
sw3658A-ms98-a,52,A,292.7895,299.394,6.6045,but um it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county,2,0
sw3659A-ms98-a,16,A,90.64525,100.620375,9.975125,but um and it's kind of disappointing i mean i would even be happy if they just had one you know one place where you could do everything you know it would still be more convenient than what we have now,2,0
sw3659A-ms98-a,35,A,158.838375,169.454125,10.61575,i think that you know i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is and so hopefully they'll do it soon that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week,1,0
sw3659A-ms98-a,36,A,169.454125,178.282625,8.8285,where i grew up we only had one a week and that was certainly sufficient so if they just do one of them will be trash and the alternate time would do recyclables that'd be great,2,0
sw3659B-ms98-a,48,B,192.016875,205.49,13.473125,but i could certainly have uh three bins out there for you know plastic and and tin and paper whatever they were going to uh separate into and and have them pick it up on on one of the two days per week that would be easy,1,0
sw3660A-ms98-a,3,A,3.601875,11.304,7.702125,uh i think it's a real good concept uh drug testing procedures would have to be refined,1,0
sw3660B-ms98-a,31,B,152.33025,163.14075,10.8105,like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better or make sure it's a lot safer because_1 a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever yeah i i i tend to agree with you David,2,0
sw3660B-ms98-a,49,B,261.1975,273.447625,12.250125,boy i can't remember that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test maybe it was during the interview i came up a couple times for an interview so it's hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened,1,0
sw3661A-ms98-a,14,A,96.17625,105.222625,9.046375,well you know the vegetable gardens don't have to be very big this plot i have is twenty two by eight so that's a hundred and seventy six square feet which is not very big and,1,0
sw3661A-ms98-a,26,A,158.544125,167.9255,9.381375,in the in the past i usually got tomatoes for three four weeks and that would be it and then in the fall i'd you know get a couple more weeks but this is a very unusual year,1,0
sw3661A-ms98-a,29,A,180.95725,186.564875,5.607625,cover the fruit from the birds and all these other things and it just proved to be more hassle than it was worth,1,0
sw3661A-ms98-a,43,A,271.3105,273.04875,1.73825,must be the soil,1,0
sw3661B-ms98-a,64,B,214.711125,228.3285,13.617375,i guess a pump- a squash plant you know turned out to be a pumpkin and uh it it bore pretty good size fruit and then one year we just let one of the squashes grow out produced a really huge pumpkin ,1,0
sw3662A-ms98-a,9,A,72.828375,81.626375,8.798,you know if they can if they made a mistake it would cost a lot of money or or people's lives then they need to be watched carefully so,1,0
sw3662B-ms98-a,6,B,22.454125,37.00875,14.554625,uh something that definitely needs to be taken care of whether that whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or in the g- or the hands of hands of the government is a you know a a different question i think as far as i'm concerned uh in a in other words i am fa- in favor of drug contr- or or or drug testing,2,0
sw3662B-ms98-a,7,B,37.00875,48.66,11.65125,um i was drug tested when i came to my job here at TI yet but but at the same time i don't think uh that should be governed by by the government uh per se i think it should be b- more by the private institution,2,0
sw3662B-ms98-a,21,B,121.703625,129.9595,8.255875,maybe we might have some some control over that we you know if you can't work then you can't  be a little bit harder to take take the drugs or whatever i don't know,1,0
sw3662B-ms98-a,48,B,234.983125,247.12425,12.141125,yeah  what do you think about um you know  something that kind of concerns me is uh you you know you and i are tested for for whatever work we happen to do do you think there should be drug testing for political officials,1,0
sw3663A-ms98-a,5,A,10.177125,24.509375,14.33225,yeah we have um in California i'm in c- i lived in central California we have rain couple times a year and other than that you know it'd be maybe October and then in the spring and then other than that there wouldn't be any rain,2,0
sw3663B-ms98-a,43,B,199.419375,208.186125,8.76675,that's interesting you don't think about that as a career a normal career uh when you're thinking of things that people might be doing,1,0
sw3663B-ms98-a,51,B,243.498125,253.83325,10.335125,yeah and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too after the last freeze and and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh i like that,1,0
sw3663B-ms98-a,52,B,253.83325,264.5175,10.68425,particularly if i'm gonna be outdoors and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things and that's nicer yeah i do quite a bit of that ,1,0
sw3663B-ms98-a,58,B,297.156875,298.626,1.469125,it  seem to be,1,0
sw3664A-ms98-a,26,A,126.769,138.558375,11.789375,yeah uh-huh but you know if there's a story that you're particularly interested in it's good to  to be able to follow up on it  you know so ,1,0
sw3664A-ms98-a,54,A,278.147875,289.544625,11.39675,so it's uh but we i enjoy it i'd hate to be without a newspaper and then we get the local you know the little Brigham City one it's uh comes once a week,1,0
sw3664B-ms98-a,55,B,204.422375,206.312625,1.89025,now that'll be nice,1,0
sw3665B-ms98-a,26,B,121.871125,135.846375,13.97525,and uh on Sunday used to be on Sunday nights now i can't figure out where they've moved it on our uh public television they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show,1,0
sw3665B-ms98-a,29,B,142.73375,150.60275,7.869,well you know it's unless you're really into computers you w- and software you probably wouldn't be interested but,1,0
sw3666A-ms98-a,83,A,195.7305,198.613125,2.882625,yeah i mean isn't it supposed to be five minutes,1,0
sw3666A-ms98-a,87,A,204.056375,208.53175,4.475375,oh i hate to think i hate to think i'd be talking to you without getting paid ,1,0
sw3666B-ms98-a,3,B,2.32375,7.080625,4.756875,yes i forgot we had to hit one     will be up,1,0
sw3666B-ms98-a,20,B,46.819875,54.71325,7.893375,well he's gonna give me an estimate and for ten dollars a week i don't see any reason for me to be doing it,1,0
sw3667A-ms98-a,48,A,228.27925,234.091375,5.812125,you know as a consumer we have to be wary of all that type of propaganda,1,0
sw3667A-ms98-a,50,A,236.5355,241.1285,4.593,  a bummer that would be a kind of a deflator,1,0
sw3667B-ms98-a,22,B,95.464625,105.805875,10.34125,well and not necessarily computers you know it can be the people sometimes the people are worse than the computers because_1 you can just hang up on the computer but the person you know will do anything to keep you on the line,1,0

sw3669B-ms98-a,47,B,164.428,172.212,7.784,one of the uh covenants is uh curiously enough uh that it has to be in harmony with the existing structures,1,0
sw3670A-ms98-a,37,A,139.35675,145.77775,6.421,that you know y- you're you're not getting what you're paying for a lot of times whereas in any other business situation it'd be see you you know,1,0
sw3670A-ms98-a,46,A,197.603,204.680875,7.077875,but just to work out with our tax money you know watch where is it going to be best used and how is it going to be most effective cost wise,2,0
sw3670B-ms98-a,13,B,82.72,94.613875,11.893875,i don't know you know it seems like it seems like we ought to be able to get a little bit uh things ought to be a little bit more efficiently run and i i i and i think that we could get by without continually raising taxes,2,0
sw3670B-ms98-a,16,B,110.43725,122.332375,11.895125,you know there's there's got to be some point where people sit down and say okay you know this is enough income to give government services at and we need to make sure we give good government service at this point and you know and,1,0

sw3672A-ms98-a,28,A,134.25675,139.349,5.09225,right it seems like it would be better all the way around if there were more curbside recycling,1,0
sw3672A-ms98-a,34,A,169.377625,175.178125,5.8005,stop being manufactured or that that they would be able to figure out a way to recycle those economically,1,0
sw3672A-ms98-a,44,A,217.147,221.562875,4.415875,you have to be motivated to do that when you're that far away after a point  ,1,0
sw3672B-ms98-a,20,B,128.467125,136.285375,7.81825,and then everything's just starts getting piled outside which is a pain because that's not what's supposed to be ,1,0
sw3672B-ms98-a,22,B,138.651,148.863875,10.212875,i think so too i i am uh in hopes that that will be successful and that they will decide to go ahead and and spread it to our neighborhood as well ,1,0

sw3677B-ms98-a,10,B,49.17375,55.843625,6.669875,it is less consistent than than it could be in terms of our ability to put money aside but um,1,0

sw3691A-ms98-a,29,A,172.53,175.467,2.937,and the skunk would be sitting at her feet,1,0
sw3691A-ms98-a,30,A,175.467,184.186125,8.719125,that the cat would be on the back of the sofa and a dog be running around crazy  oh,2,0
sw3691A-ms98-a,34,A,196.0235,209.036625,13.013125,oh my son bought this snake uh  someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school and it was just a small thing then but it got to be pretty big and you know you'd feed it you put and feed him that small mice to big rats and things like that and ,1,0

sw3692B-ms98-a,21,B,99.182625,104.085625,4.903,well i mean it's it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process right that you've got,1,0
sw3693A-ms98-a,10,A,22.209125,30.051625,7.8425,that is lucky well how old um does a child have to be before you have to you get to stop making arrangements for him i wonder,1,0

sw3693A-ms98-a,28,A,98.125875,107.486,9.360125,so that we would just switch back and forth like that but um it's really scary and i would really hate to be in a position to have to find child ,1,0
sw3693A-ms98-a,43,A,177.202875,182.0555,4.852625,so far i think my preference would be rather than to have like a,1,0

sw3693A-ms98-a,57,A,246.6075,256.711125,10.103625,so i think uh my preference would be a small small if i had to find day care would be a small someone that i knew ,2,0

sw3723A-ms98-a,32,A,156.987875,167.936875,10.949,and i understand that walking is suppose to be like the best exercise better than running things like that because_1 it it works everything and it gets your breathing up and it it doesn't,1,0
sw3723A-ms98-a,54,A,249.695,263.259,13.564,yeah i know a lot of people just to be safe like you were talking about walking at night and in the morning early in the morning um you see a lot of uh mostly older people though but that uh walk in the malls,1,0
sw3723B-ms98-a,18,B,66.583875,78.56575,11.981875,well i understand that i've been trying to get myself motivated i had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor uh she had injured her back and needed a walking partner and i thought that'd be the time to get going,1,0
sw3723B-ms98-a,37,B,174.02825,183.1515,9.12325,yeah yeah the last time i tried running with my daughter because_1 she's supposed to be jogging in P E and it felt good but then i had,1,0
sw3723B-ms98-a,50,B,237.153125,252.003625,14.8505,yeah well i've got a dog now and and of course she needs walking and so that's a little less try you kn- uh burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her and i do put on the earphones to have something to listen to and,1,0
sw3724A-ms98-a,13,A,50.097375,57.19025,7.092875,yeah yeah it's it's more probably an issue in a large organization than it would be in a small one,1,0
sw3724A-ms98-a,19,A,83.8605,91.302875,7.442375,well i definitely think that health care packages and that sort of thing are probably gonna be easier to coordinate you kn- in a larger,1,0
sw3724A-ms98-a,39,A,199.328125,206.08025,6.752125,he didn't really ever pursue individual benefits and i think it makes a difference to be able to have the  of an organization's benefits,1,0
sw3724A-ms98-a,42,A,224.614,231.001625,6.387625,um they offered for the first time a life term that would be up to a hundred and fifty but you have to pay into it,1,0
sw3724B-ms98-a,34,B,138.157,149.447875,11.290875,um typically let's see uh typically the myself i- i was covered myself but my family wasn't you know i had to chip in t- for them to be covered but it was pretty economical,1,0
sw3724B-ms98-a,36,B,153.779875,165.084625,11.30475,yeah and so you kn- so that's that's handy uh you know i think that i- i'm amazed that uh of the one place i was working uh what they calculate to be their overhead,1,0
sw3725A-ms98-a,79,A,239.968625,247.26425,7.295625,that's pretty much it yeah okay it's gonna be such and such a weekend and uh y'all come  that's about it,1,0
sw3726A-ms98-a,34,A,204.67425,209.73775,5.0635,and they're not attracted by the the work that has to be done to achieve,1,0
sw3726A-ms98-a,45,A,259.81025,267.393,7.58275,the important issues need to be not so as much what's going on other places i mean that it's important for us to do,1,0
sw3726A-ms98-a,46,A,267.393,274.631125,7.238125,i mean we we can't be isolated here but um you know we do need to pay more attention to our own economy and,1,0
sw3726B-ms98-a,15,B,89.552125,98.353875,8.80175,and i think there's a lot of things that need to be done to to rectify that situation i'm not sure that the government is the key player,1,0
sw3726B-ms98-a,19,B,107.610875,119.6445,12.033625,when he was announcing some of the problems that existed in the Soviet Union he made the comment he said well our country may be bankrupt but referring to the United States he says your schools are bankrupt,1,0
sw3726B-ms98-a,33,B,229.466875,238.659875,9.193,you know being creative and there was another group of students there that were there to be engineers because they heard that engineers made a lot of money,1,0
sw3727A-ms98-a,55,A,177.151,182.43075,5.27975,uh classes for pace classes i think uh this happens to be uh,1,0
sw3727A-ms98-a,65,A,213.0915,215.1655,2.074,that'd be fun,1,0
sw3727B-ms98-a,6,B,7.72825,16.141625,8.413375,well we ha- yeah we do we have a our si- a six year old he's oldest and then um our baby will be a year on Monday,1,0
sw3728B-ms98-a,38,B,143.9485,152.59225,8.64375,paper but most of the ti- the times i find that even if there are you know they do have like tremors out there uh you know there'll be a small article in the paper about it,1,0
sw3728B-ms98-a,51,B,195.05225,200.066625,5.014375,yeah sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad ,1,0
sw3728B-ms98-a,65,B,230.9465,239.435625,8.489125,uh  and it was really funny i i i mixed it made the call and it happened to be my friend who lives    ,1,0
sw3729A-ms98-a,1,A,0,7.5595,7.5595,o-  -kay well i think this is going to probably be the most difficult topic that i've discussed   yes well have you returned anything lately,1,0
sw3729B-ms98-a,19,B,88.985625,102.93375,13.948125,and and i think that's unusual for that company because they do usually have pretty good products but to to answer the question that we were posed about whether things tend to be poor quality i think definitely i think a lot of the things that um,1,0
sw3729B-ms98-a,20,B,102.93375,111.064375,8.130625,are not necessarily low price tend to be manufactured in a lot of cases as if they were  ,1,0
sw3729B-ms98-a,29,B,144.923625,156.8425,11.918875,they are really nice stores and i think i assumed in the beginning that they would probably ca- carry overall pretty good merchandise you you have to be just as careful there as you do at any other lower priced store,1,0
sw3730A-ms98-a,44,A,91.6725,95.88875,4.21625,but the kids sometimes are so rowdy and want to be outside that that stuff doesn't go over too well she,1,0
sw3730A-ms98-a,57,A,141.3125,143.862125,2.549625,you can't be screaming at them_1   but,1,0
sw3730A-ms98-a,62,A,160.801625,172.054,11.252375,well we i think they usually charge about twelve bucks a day so i think we're pretty cheap i heard once that like out in Boston it could be upwards of four hundred dollars a month and here you and yeah,1,0
sw3731B-ms98-a,27,B,100.500125,107.084125,6.584,i never caught anything or never been uh sa- salt water fishing that sounds like you know kind of be a lot of fun i've seen these guys that,1,0
sw3732A-ms98-a,10,A,45.1385,55.469,10.3305,like serial killers or someone who has been convicted more than three times on a murder charge and then gotten out on parole i don't think they should be able to get out on parole and do it again,1,0
sw3732A-ms98-a,42,A,177.23275,178.448875,1.216125,be,1,0
sw3732A-ms98-a,43,A,178.448875,183.98625,5.537375,something to be done with them_1 other than just sitting there for two years and then getting out and doing it again ,1,0
sw3732A-ms98-a,61,A,230.89625,237.740625,6.844375,i don't know a lot of the crimes that are done nowadays it's like i think people have to be off the wall to do them_1 but,1,0
sw3732A-ms98-a,62,A,237.740625,242.108125,4.3675,i still don't believe capital punishment should be used unless they're repeat offenders,1,0
sw3732A-ms98-a,68,A,254.59975,258.47725,3.8775, i'll be able to do something about it then ,1,0
sw3732A-ms98-a,73,A,274.67575,277.221375,2.545625,that would be the more humane way of doing it,1,0
sw3732B-ms98-a,30,B,102.543,106.873,4.33,they can't be re- rehabilitated either so yeah,1,0
sw3733A-ms98-a,20,A,82.825125,87.055875,4.23075,right now hobbies pretty much tend to be on hold,1,0
sw3733A-ms98-a,46,A,235.46975,246.57675,11.107,retirement homes that try to make it sound like it's a real you know luxury condominium setup b- still the you know the bulk of the people living there tend to be living pretty restricted lives,1,0
sw3733A-ms98-a,47,A,246.57675,249.8675,3.29075,so something like that can be a lot of fun,1,0
sw3734A-ms98-a,4,A,12.51575,21.499375,8.983625,i dress very variedly  if that's a word um sometimes i'm shooting and doing photography and so i'll be in jeans one day and,1,0
sw3734A-ms98-a,5,A,21.499375,26.884125,5.38475,another day i'll be on camera and so i'll be in a suit and another day,2,0
sw3734A-ms98-a,50,A,169.201875,174.69375,5.491875,uh where i wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things and i could then i would be able to dress,1,0
sw3734B-ms98-a,59,B,198.220875,205.68025,7.459375,um i'm gonna be a teacher so i'll probably just wear uh casual clothes maybe skirts and s-,1,0
sw3735B-ms98-a,45,B,168.164375,174.262375,6.098,oh yeah that and that's what i hate doing is the finishing stuff it it'd be nice to have that,1,0
sw3736A-ms98-a,21,A,84.571625,87.64,3.068375,yeah it seems to be made out of something different,1,0
sw3736B-ms98-a,37,B,202.246125,209.97125,7.725125,but i thought that was pretty neat it it would be nice if more communities could do that but you have to know from beginning and you have to have the space to do it and ,1,0
sw3736B-ms98-a,39,B,210.9745,220.2685,9.294,yeah see that's well they're already planning a second mountain so they're gonna get going to be called the Twin Peaks i was like uh-huh go back to the TV shows ,1,0
sw3736B-ms98-a,40,B,220.2685,224.426,4.1575,this it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling,1,0
sw3736B-ms98-a,51,B,289.039375,298.562,9.522625,but at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing and she got our baby sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans because that's all she talked about so i guess wha-,1,0
sw3737B-ms98-a,27,B,134.426875,140.922625,6.49575,it's a it's a lot of fun you just you have to be careful so you don't like go lopping your fingers off or anything,1,0
sw3738B-ms98-a,9,B,124.5205,135.5085,10.988, i think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that the  they seem to be social they seem to be economically driven also,2,0
sw3738B-ms98-a,21,B,228.415,237.562625,9.147625,and not giving them_1 the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which i think's gonna be a hard thing for for people to face,1,0
sw3738B-ms98-a,25,B,252.896375,258.780125,5.88375, there probably needs to be some training on how to to to to adjust to these changes as they come about ,1,0
sw3739A-ms98-a,9,A,40.126375,53.445375,13.319,i see big opportunities in Europe opening up uh it just it just seems to me like we ought to be able to go over there and help the people become a capitalistic society,1,0
sw3739B-ms98-a,10,B,52.94275,58.82325,5.8805,yes i think they're looking for that they just need guidance yes that would be very good for us to help,1,0
sw3739B-ms98-a,38,B,210.374875,213.672875,3.298,but it'll be an interesting uh concept i'm sure,1,0
sw3739B-ms98-a,44,B,240.77325,253.885625,13.112375,i understand well it's unfortunate you had that problem and i do hope you will be able to work out your circumstances so that you can live comfortably and feel confident that you are doing your share of the taxes ,1,0
sw3740A-ms98-a,14,A,37.29925,47.996625,10.697375,we're gonna get along well  well i like fiction uh matter of fact well my favorite would be horror type stories such as Stephen King and such,1,0
sw3740B-ms98-a,46,B,238.9285,245.631125,6.702625,well they did but um i don't think it was as scary as i expected it to be i- i really you know,1,0
sw3740B-ms98-a,48,B,249.39375,255.04975,5.656,i expected it to be i don't know but it was a good it was a good movie,1,0
sw3740B-ms98-a,51,B,262.60775,269.15875,6.551,uh probably another murder thing you know that's usually what he you know well thi- this'll be i think his fourth or fifth book,1,0
sw3741A-ms98-a,13,A,58.191375,61.721375,3.53,i can't they got to be just a lot of pictures and not too much else,1,0
sw3741A-ms98-a,41,A,162.983,168.203375,5.220375,there's a lot to be said wi- with parents you know for parents spending time with their kids that's for sure,1,0
sw3741A-ms98-a,78,A,283.99825,293.271,9.27275,we're just like i say we just all i keep hearing is from my mom is just you wait you know you'll get all that you ever gave so  i could be in trouble but,1,0
sw3741B-ms98-a,71,B,222.987125,235.906375,12.91925,i i think one of the hardest things to do with children is to be consistent and and uh in your discipline cause some days when you're feeling pretty good you wouldn't mind letting them get away with murder then on days when you don't feel well,1,0
sw3741B-ms98-a,76,B,250.835875,257.468375,6.6325,but uh uh that that was the hardest thing i found was to be consistent and if,1,0
sw3743A-ms98-a,45,A,145.344375,154.1695,8.825125, yeah and it really it's affecting the families you know for mothers not not to be home and yet you know um,1,0
sw3743B-ms98-a,15,B,42.410875,48.488875,6.078,it used to be that our list ran nineteen twenty twenty one for our patients' ages,1,0
sw3743B-ms98-a,19,B,74.05125,81.427375,7.376125,they probably would be married and having their children  so  i guess it's a combination,1,0
sw3743B-ms98-a,47,B,226.709375,237.5125,10.803125,well it's gonna be interesting i yeah i think it will change but i'm not sure how it's going to because i see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford,1,0
sw3744A-ms98-a,18,A,109.164125,117.816875,8.65275,that only the most adaptable are gonna be able to uh survive and and keep from just being overrun by the changes,1,0
sw3744A-ms98-a,26,A,145.528875,151.574125,6.04525,that it can be ah stable number one you've got uh you know you see on the news,1,0
sw3744B-ms98-a,26,B,129.080625,139.1975,10.116875,it's just you know it it's almost unthinkable but it it is hey in a i i still wonder whether you know that it's going to be stable and then what's going to happen there,1,0
sw3744B-ms98-a,31,B,179.590375,182.6065,3.016125,to to be distributed that were being held off,1,0
sw3745A-ms98-a,2,A,0.181375,4.832,4.650625,um serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it,1,0
sw3745A-ms98-a,40,A,256.143625,258.577,2.433375,all the children could be exposed to that program,1,0
sw3745B-ms98-a,33,B,211.406875,221.741125,10.33425,they may be uh good students but they just haven't achieved to their fullest potential and they're gonna fail unless some sort of remedial uh,1,0
sw3746A-ms98-a,15,A,39.704125,42.539875,2.83575,i was gonna say that could be difficult,1,0
sw3746A-ms98-a,19,A,57.4725,59.546125,2.073625,i think that might be true,1,0
sw3746A-ms98-a,40,A,150.27725,159.293875,9.016625,but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them_1 again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it's gonna probably be six to eight years before they go to college,1,0
sw3746B-ms98-a,55,B,219.5035,223.484875,3.981375,so those ought to be coming up around spring time ,1,0
sw3748A-ms98-a,17,A,108.478,115.735125,7.257125,uh i myself have a son who hopes to be a doctor in a couple three more years and uh  he is doing it for the money,1,0
sw3748A-ms98-a,20,A,119.5,125.498125,5.998125,but he agrees with me though that there should be something worked out for the people that can't afford it,1,0
sw3748A-ms98-a,46,A,276.0035,288.476625,12.473125,i think Kerrey is and i think also Jerry Brown from California are interested uh actually the way Bush has been going the last few weeks i think he may be interested uh  he he seem to be,2,0
sw3748B-ms98-a,7,B,17.27175,23.469125,6.197375,somehow there needs to be some controls on the rising costs of of health care,1,0
sw3748B-ms98-a,37,B,207.194625,214.481125,7.2865,uh in i guess in addition to uh uh national health care policy there uh there has to be some sort of,1,0
sw3749A-ms98-a,78,A,265.113875,269.546375,4.4325,yeah i'm a little out of my field of what i wanna be i'm an  auditor for a credit union but,1,0
sw3750A-ms98-a,86,A,292.112125,297.45625,5.344125,yeah oh that's a that'll be pretty that's really pretty out there,1,0
sw3750B-ms98-a,20,B,126.12375,136.269375,10.145625,so uh and we're at the end of the mail route  like i said we are probably as far as you can get from a Seven Eleven and still be in Texas,1,0
sw3751A-ms98-a,41,A,132.7215,145.788,13.0665,i would be interested to find out how many people or how much uh people use credit this year say in nineteen ninety two as opposed to nineteen ninety one even nineteen ninety,1,0
sw3751A-ms98-a,42,A,145.788,150.264,4.476,i think i think it be amazing how much how many more people use it,1,0
sw3751A-ms98-a,46,A,157.47325,161.740125,4.266875,i would be very i would like to see some numbers on that i think that would be interesting,2,0
sw3751A-ms98-a,81,A,247.494375,254.002,6.507625,uh a place i guess that would be similar to Prime Air it is called H G H or something like K G H or,1,0
sw3752A-ms98-a,18,A,111.22075,124.363875,13.143125,that uh she said their English is excellent uh their their so- social skills are good and uh you know why is it that uh that they can be such model citizens and uh yet,1,0
sw3752A-ms98-a,23,A,156.487,163.206625,6.719625,yeah i'm beginning to wonder if maybe um year round school would not be a bad uh a bad thing,1,0
sw3752A-ms98-a,40,A,267.992,273.22625,5.23425,but i don't know if that's the answer but i do think that there needs to be some changes made somewhere along the way,1,0
sw3752B-ms98-a,37,B,146.95175,157.07875,10.127,uh to get into college is uh no small feat there i mean just to be accepted i'm sure there are other countries that put a little more pressure on their on their children than than we do,1,0
sw3753A-ms98-a,12,A,37.41375,41.609125,4.195375,oh it's supposed to be more of a colony than a than a research lab,1,0
sw3753A-ms98-a,30,A,96.6495,104.365375,7.715875,yeah so it was all modular like you send up a small section it'd be liveable for a couple of people and they send up another section and bolt it on and,1,0
sw3753A-ms98-a,62,A,261.89225,270.722625,8.830375,well actually it needs to be put off for a little while for now just because_1 there's so much money going into it that would be a whole lot better spent on on local problems,2,0
sw3753B-ms98-a,8,B,26.45975,36.0505,9.59075,they had some professor on there who was uh building a it was like a it was kind of like a space station but it was supposed to be for people you know and uh experimental stages,1,0
sw3753B-ms98-a,9,B,36.0505,38.42675,2.37625,and it's supposed to be about ten miles long,1,0
sw3753B-ms98-a,11,B,40.56625,47.5475,6.98125,right right well th- they were all gonna be research scientists out there and they were just gonna build it up and make it bigger and bigger,1,0
sw3753B-ms98-a,12,B,47.5475,53.153875,5.606375,and but the initial stage was supposed to be about_1 ten miles long which is i mean huge for i guess for space,1,0
sw3753B-ms98-a,18,B,85.0575,93.165,8.1075,not if you got to think about it was five or six years they said you know by nineteen ninety seven or nineteen ninety eight we would actually be able to uh to start launching this thing,1,0
sw3753B-ms98-a,25,B,118.496,131.887375,13.391375,no it was pretty it wa- no it was a it was a gravity free  they uh they had show- they had shown like at some sort of uh simulation on how it would be up there and they showed people floating around so uh,1,0
sw3753B-ms98-a,66,B,248.1545,258.53925,10.38475,the uh at the EPCOT Center i- in uh i think it's the the AT and T display they show a a bunch of uh future space pods and what life would be like out in space,1,0
sw3755A-ms98-a,6,A,15.545875,21.22275,5.676875,yeah uh that sort of a trip can be kind of long just by yourself,1,0
sw3755A-ms98-a,33,A,146.18925,154.707125,8.517875,the next trip is probably going to be next Christmas uh several of my siblings have decided that it'd been too long since we were home for Christmas,1,0
sw3755A-ms98-a,62,A,284.725125,288.563625,3.8385,uh one trip i used to be an auto mechanic,1,0

sw3756A-ms98-a,32,A,90.425375,92.409875,1.9845,oh that'd be nice,1,0
sw3756A-ms98-a,86,A,283.26825,290.925875,7.657625,but uh i think i'll probably just do it in a roller i wanna do it about the same color and just be a little,1,0
sw3756B-ms98-a,13,B,42.25875,49.75,7.49125,that are real soft and furry that you'd paint that with how you get the edge you just have to be real careful,1,0
sw3756B-ms98-a,25,B,102.266625,107.868375,5.60175,there's some columns that could be painted a different color too what color did you paint your house,1,0
sw3757B-ms98-a,37,B,192.62275,199.892,7.26925,uh i'm not i'm not that happy to always be uh limited to just summers for most vacations and,1,0
sw3758B-ms98-a,13,B,66.83825,69.85125,3.013, to be able to uh,1,0
sw3758B-ms98-a,23,B,144.10725,156.387375,12.280125,um  high-powered computer input and whatnot if i could just ask them_1 questions i could tell that they're gonna be good jurors for you and bad jurors for me i'm gonna strike them_1 so you're not going to get them_1,1,0
sw3759B-ms98-a,2,B,1.846875,6.58325,4.736375,yeah something about uh returning goods and uh if they're getting any better than they used to be,1,0
sw3759B-ms98-a,26,B,101.5105,112.161625,10.651125,try to do my homework to to find which brand i think is probably going to be the best thing and and generally i am you know pretty well happy with it afterwards sometimes you may find it uh on sale elsewhere but ,1,0
sw3760B-ms98-a,36,B,130.021625,135.607,5.585375,so that's i- i think i would probably consider that a hobby although sometimes it gets to be excessive ,1,0
sw3760B-ms98-a,41,B,153.051875,157.19,4.138125,it it not only can it be fun but it can certainly help your finances,1,0
sw3760B-ms98-a,49,B,183.304375,193.301125,9.99675,um i- i don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art i guess graphics arts is that what that would be called it i can't like do any of that but sweat shirts is certainly impressive,1,0
sw3761A-ms98-a,15,A,43.14725,53.12125,9.974,i had i had started that one about a year ago thinking that it would be a nice way to get some decorating tips and and more interior kinds of things but um ,1,0
sw3761A-ms98-a,44,A,153.01875,162.048,9.02925,i wondered how often people subscribe to those kinds of magazines because_1 you almost have to be in the business to be as intrigued with some of those fashions they're so ,2,0
sw3761A-ms98-a,56,A,212.687625,222.0165,9.328875,hm i don't know Redbook very well what what does it tend to be a mix of uh fashion and and recipes and that sort of thing or what what did,1,0
sw3761B-ms98-a,42,B,263.663,270.741125,7.078125,yeah they used to be a big magazine and you know they cut the size down and,1,0
sw3762A-ms98-a,24,A,70.025125,77.82175,7.796625,yeah well i've never done any motor home camping although uh uh it it is more attractive to me now than it used to be,1,0
sw3762B-ms98-a,12,B,45.235375,49.736375,4.501,and uh we thought the beaches would be nice but uh,1,0
sw3762B-ms98-a,54,B,256.482625,265.98975,9.507125,uh i've found that i get there just about as fast as anybody else because there will be some cars that i'll pass two or three times during the day the same one,1,0
sw3763A-ms98-a,8,A,46.2465,52.605875,6.359375,what are your thinkings on what they can do what they'll be able to do,1,0
sw3763B-ms98-a,29,B,112.98325,116.50025,3.517,uh pay him what his salary's going to be,1,0
sw3763B-ms98-a,54,B,225.954875,231.247,5.292125,but Howse might be a different uh situation and i think you're probably right that they,1,0
sw3763B-ms98-a,61,B,267.975125,278.739625,10.7645,oh i know you know it's too bad that uh it has to be a forty two year old guy to to lead the uh the Rangers you know,1,0
sw3764A-ms98-a,18,A,103.486625,114.060625,10.574,one day i got up and thought well i'll just go casual and do you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls  and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional,1,0
sw3764A-ms98-a,23,A,133.023875,145.562625,12.53875,it depends on who you call on in my business if i call on the  the JC Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago then i wear coat and tie if i call on just uh  a normal little dealer of mine i might be casual,1,0
sw3764A-ms98-a,24,A,145.562625,151.94825,6.385625,i call on Oshman's sporting goods again it may be casual or it may be coat and tie so it just it it depends,2,0
sw3764A-ms98-a,30,A,165.702625,178.286,12.583375,today i believe you can get away with it but then it depends on who you're calling on who you're it'd be like your your minister standing up in front of you with no tie you just uh he'd be missing something although he shouldn't be evaluated on that,3,0
sw3765A-ms98-a,7,A,12.89275,17.253,4.36025,going to be interesting to see what happens as the criminal justice system,1,0
sw3765A-ms98-a,18,A,60.59325,65.129625,4.536375,i think its going to be very interesting because its uh,1,0
sw3765A-ms98-a,32,A,156.00575,164.36525,8.3595,well there are a lot of people who think that that that works pretty well and it'll be interesting to see what uh what we go to because it's uh ,1,0
sw3765A-ms98-a,38,A,190.178125,197.990875,7.81275,it's gonna to be interesting to see whether or not it becomes more streamlined uh because of the cost involved in that the uh,1,0
sw3765A-ms98-a,41,A,205.234875,210.210125,4.97525,you know the the requirement that that people be given a trial and and,1,0
sw3765A-ms98-a,49,A,260.5705,270.321875,9.751375,they they they've done that in San Francisco and uh you know it's gonna be interesting to see how all these things change as as we look at the cost of it because,1,0
sw3765B-ms98-a,25,B,140.44825,147.624375,7.176125,i think you need to get tough with them_1 and quit calling them_1 i don't think they need air conditioned cells and color TV sets they need to be put on hard labor m-,1,0
sw3765B-ms98-a,38,B,244.9225,249.2965,4.374,i don't think it'll work here but over there the the way they're doing it it seems to be effective,1,0
sw3766A-ms98-a,9,A,32.090875,40.6865,8.595625,oh okay you're having to be in reruns for that one have you seen Brooklyn Bridge,1,0
sw3766A-ms98-a,18,A,78.975375,93.430875,14.4555,and i think it's a shame that our life has to be i mean so many of the tragedies that we have on the movies or on TV no we need something lighter than that  have you seen um,1,0
sw3766B-ms98-a,16,B,72.4045,78.0185,5.614,i just don't even like to be in the room when all of those are on it's like too much real life,1,0
sw3766B-ms98-a,34,B,172.993625,180.273875,7.28025, my favorite teams are back east and they seem to be the best ones anyway so,1,0
sw3767A-ms98-a,48,A,213.450125,223.111875,9.66175,uh the kind that you pump you know that you can change the loading and she rides that and that seems to be uh probably other than walking that's probably one of the better things you can do,1,0
sw3767A-ms98-a,54,A,235.0365,244.752375,9.715875,with four children and sometimes there may be times you can't get out to go play you need to stay home that maybe one of these mechanical bicycles would be very helpful to you,2,0
sw3767A-ms98-a,58,A,259.74725,269.84875,10.1015,considering it i'm going to get on that bicycle that we have and uh start doing some riding and i'm sure that's going to be the quickest way to get things under control ,1,0
sw3767B-ms98-a,62,B,242.57025,246.276375,3.706125,that would be a gr- yeah it sure would that would be a great idea,2,0
sw3767B-ms98-a,81,B,292.8745,298.562,5.6875,well that yeah well that would be interesting do you study like mammals or just sound,1,0
sw3768B-ms98-a,80,B,266.6445,275.006875,8.362375,and then of course when that movie Out of Africa came out  um but i've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there,1,0
sw3769A-ms98-a,68,A,250.349,257.497625,7.148625,an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and you know have dinner and then come on back but uh,1,0
sw3769B-ms98-a,59,B,226.7015,229.388375,2.686875,oh that would be fun,1,0
sw3770A-ms98-a,43,A,199.64675,202.41425,2.7675,w- you know grandmother be like that,1,0
sw3770A-ms98-a,50,A,242.999875,252.892125,9.89225,no but like you say there is a tendency for people to be abandoned though you know in the nursing home i do remember the other patients there um,1,0
sw3770B-ms98-a,3,B,4.561875,18.08875,13.526875,yes i have in fact uh just a little over just a little less than a year ago uh my mother went to be with the Lord and we cared for her the last uh oh seventeen months of her life here in the at home,1,0
sw3770B-ms98-a,60,B,259.760375,269.630375,9.87,in fact just to just to sit and chat with them_1 for five minutes and and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is,1,0
sw3770B-ms98-a,70,B,297.165625,298.946,1.780375,uh be,1,0
sw3771A-ms98-a,2,A,0.06,6.75675,6.69675,because uh discuss crime in America and what we might be ab- uh do to uh help stop it,1,0
sw3771B-ms98-a,15,B,42.018375,46.68825,4.669875,oh there's a lot of homicides in Dallas that seems to be,1,0
sw3772A-ms98-a,2,A,5.962375,12.658875,6.6965,they were just talking about how they had all these drive by shootings and stuff and it sounded like it was getting to be like LA a little bit but,1,0
sw3772A-ms98-a,31,A,113.94,123.326375,9.386375,you can see it getting a little bit worse and worse it it's pretty sad like you say you see all these kids thirteen fourteen year olds and you know it'll be a school night and they're out at ten eleven o'clock just roaming the streets and,1,0
sw3772A-ms98-a,39,A,148.137875,161.868875,13.731,yeah with with that with that Mormon influence it may not be as bad but we still get a lot of the two uh the two parent income or the two income families and and i really think that's a lot of the problem its just you don't get all the the values taught in the home that you used to get,1,0
sw3772B-ms98-a,16,B,35.3735,39.4515,4.078,but some of my sixth graders will be thirteen fourteen years old,1,0
sw3772B-ms98-a,70,B,265.21625,271.04525,5.829,and he's just been tearing my school up and he told me he's gonna be bad enough to be sent back to Mississippi,2,0
sw3773B-ms98-a,30,B,123.5255,133.198875,9.673375,yeah yeah we've got five and the oldest is uh ninth grade and the youngest is second grade and i think they're gonna be uh with us forever ,1,0
sw3773B-ms98-a,32,B,143.143125,149.751875,6.60875,oh yeah in fact six would be real good my wife and i can share a bedroom  and there,1,0
sw3773B-ms98-a,37,B,166.32275,177.175,10.85225,if we find something for uh i'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we'll be doing all right you know that's uh but i think the thing's out there it's just a matter of uh,1,0
sw3773B-ms98-a,44,B,198.677625,205.2085,6.530875,oh yeah yeah i think once we get into a place it'll be just fine but um you know it's until then it's uh,1,0
sw3773B-ms98-a,53,B,259.553625,267.6105,8.056875,uh it's got an office down here in uh it near Duncanville and we just moved down to be on staff down here so,1,0
sw3773B-ms98-a,60,B,280.26775,293.41925,13.1515,when we moved from Louisiana to Denver it was astounding you know to find that prices were oh i guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected and then uh to come down here we thought things would be lower and they're not,1,0
sw3774A-ms98-a,10,A,42.073625,54.1315,12.057875, um outside lights and  we put up a fence in the backyard mostly you know not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in but that our children would be safe playing in the yard you know ,1,0
sw3774A-ms98-a,31,A,159.794375,168.78425,8.989875,but uh it's really scary to know that y- you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe and,2,0
sw3774A-ms98-a,34,A,174.343125,188.88075,14.537625,safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are like drug related or  um things that places usually that i wouldn't be going  and things i usually wouldn't be involved in,2,0
sw3774A-ms98-a,52,A,277.641375,292.475625,14.83425,and so that's been something that's been good for the  you know in this area that you feel like um you know there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today  and i guess i don't know how people live with that everyday,1,0
sw3774B-ms98-a,60,B,233.873375,244.87675,11.003375,i did you know i wouldn't be caught dead like being out that late at night  in a dark parking lot  so,1,0

sw3775A-ms98-a,40,A,152.589875,162.657,10.067125,which um it looked like it would be very hard to do but it ended up being really easy and it just really just makes the rooms,1,0
sw3775B-ms98-a,31,B,190.353125,200.628125,10.275,that seems to be i think she ought to be a paint expert she's just in the wrong career field   we watch This Old House faithfully on Saturdays and,2,0
sw3776A-ms98-a,13,A,43.5335,54.209875,10.676375,research the problem from the point of view of uh uh what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically you may be familiar with cooperative learning,2,0
sw3776A-ms98-a,28,A,161.55175,174.103625,12.551875,uh of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly uh accelerate the the pace of learning,1,0
sw3776A-ms98-a,33,A,193.258125,200.18425,6.926125,uh inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior so it must be the way we're managing the process that,1,0
sw3776A-ms98-a,45,A,265.724375,269.838125,4.11375,well Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe,1,0
sw3777A-ms98-a,14,A,39.577625,47.124625,7.547,uh we we always enjoyed it it it seems to be kind of halfway between um,1,0
sw3777A-ms98-a,32,A,101.120625,113.072375,11.95175,um used to be a big fan of Star Trek but that's kind of th- th- it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against um anything,1,0
sw3777A-ms98-a,37,A,122.390375,126.101375,3.711,yeah i- i used to be a used to be a real big fan of Star Trek,2,0
sw3777A-ms98-a,71,A,228.856875,236.428625,7.57175,the new cartoons don't seem to be worth much but the uh well a couple of the uh ones Disney's doing aren't too bad but,1,0
sw3777B-ms98-a,29,B,124.721625,127.320125,2.5985,used to be a Trekkie huh ,1,0
sw3777B-ms98-a,49,B,177.910375,184.606625,6.69625,well we're we're expecting our first in about three months so i know we won't be watching as much as we do now ,1,0
sw3777B-ms98-a,53,B,189.715875,191.89975,2.183875,that must be tough,1,0
sw3777B-ms98-a,56,B,197.028,203.199375,6.171375, well we had a sonogram but we told him not to tell us so it's gonna be a surprise ,1,0
sw3777B-ms98-a,60,B,211.423625,221.489,10.065375,yeah  i agree  i'm sure we'll be watching more uh children oriented television shows,1,0
sw3777B-ms98-a,64,B,236.039875,239.894875,3.855,well you know it seems like a lot of them_1 are a lot more violent than they used to be,1,0
sw3778A-ms98-a,14,A,29.43275,33.152875,3.720125, so i was trying to be prepared this time around,1,0
sw3779B-ms98-a,20,B,64.51775,72.84025,8.3225,where there's three beams and you take your clubs and you hit the ball and they give you a screen of what you would be seeing from where you lie,1,0
sw3779B-ms98-a,45,B,159.513625,166.91725,7.403625,well that may be too he's he's not the most attractive guy on the on the tour i'll say that but uh ,1,0
sw3780A-ms98-a,4,A,10.7155,20.1965,9.481,but -] that's a that's a hundred thousand mile tune-up so i guess if it'll gives me another fifty thousand in between i'll be happy with it,1,0
sw3780B-ms98-a,45,B,211.916375,221.6105,9.694125,and he couldn't figure out what was going on he'd check his oil and you know it would still be up there and it hadn't u- hadn't added any oil but there was this oil slick in his parking spot,1,0
sw3781A-ms98-a,3,A,2.312125,5.694625,3.3825,um-hum yeah they seem to be a part of life  ,1,0
sw3781A-ms98-a,22,A,52.67375,65.295875,12.622125,i watched my grandmother go into debt  on them and so i've and then i guess my mother yeah so my mother learned from that and i guess she taught me to be very very careful with them so,1,0
sw3781A-ms98-a,33,A,122.982625,133.486625,10.504,so you know  a bill will come in and i'll think oh no i didn't know it was going to be that high but so far i've been able to we've been able to pay it off every time so,1,0
sw3781B-ms98-a,60,B,248.784875,257.291,8.506125,um-hum yeah i've got some that i you know i haven't even used at all uh past few years i probably wouldn't be able to use them,1,0
sw3782A-ms98-a,25,A,67.5305,70.175,2.6445, if they put state tax in i mean i'll be pretty upset,1,0
sw3782A-ms98-a,28,A,84.422875,87.82225,3.399375,i'll be pretty mad because_1 sixty dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually you know,1,0
sw3782A-ms98-a,78,A,279.67,283.948875,4.278875,okay yeah someone just mentioned this program to me so i thought it'd be kind of cool,1,0
sw3783A-ms98-a,11,A,29.7105,41.37425,11.66375,um i would think that would be the hardest part about having a home computer is the it seems like every month  they're coming out with something new and so then you're not compa- oh yeah,1,0
sw3783A-ms98-a,28,A,114.213875,120.874375,6.6605,i'm not real good with computers at all and that's mainly because i don't use them i wish i did i'd be you know,1,0
sw3783A-ms98-a,39,A,161.37325,169.85,8.47675,but it looked pretty nice and it's only gonna be two thousand dollars so which is not bad for something new like that so,1,0
sw3783A-ms98-a,60,A,262.052375,272.243125,10.19075,that you never quite use and you don't really know what it's  and you know it can be fascinating in that way too especially for a kid that you know is just learning so,1,0
sw3783A-ms98-a,62,A,273.812375,280.7925,6.980125,well hopefully i'll be able to get a computer at some point i don't know when but i don't need one right now,1,0
sw3783B-ms98-a,75,B,285.410125,294.998875,9.58875,oh i think that day'll happen i'm hoping and perhaps uh what'll ultimately happen is you won't have to commute as much  but you'll be able to do so much from home,1,0
sw3783B-ms98-a,76,B,294.998875,298.082,3.083125, that uh you know you won't have to be driving around li-,1,0
sw3784A-ms98-a,11,A,51.7775,55.203375,3.425875,rehabilitation and and he should be,1,0
sw3784A-ms98-a,43,A,180.623875,187.139125,6.51525,you know if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death,1,0
sw3784B-ms98-a,3,B,14.520625,26.666125,12.1455,and uh  m- i personally have uh my own feelings about uh the capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony,1,0
sw3784B-ms98-a,17,B,82.1465,87.132625,4.986125,i think it should be applied  on a little bit more fair manner,1,0
sw3784B-ms98-a,18,B,87.132625,100.097375,12.96475,uh  and i've i've said this very often and i believe it to be the a a very true axiom so i would be rather be white rich and guilty than black and innocent,3,0
sw3784B-ms98-a,47,B,250.306875,257.314,7.007125,and the judicial mishap in this event would be hey you got the wrong guy look at that guy uh at E Systems,1,0
sw3785A-ms98-a,67,A,254.006375,267.993125,13.98675,yeah that's true that's true yeah i- i am i like a lot of the times you know i think the social aspect can be maybe as important and in a lot of ways as the education they get uh,1,0
sw3785B-ms98-a,22,B,90.506875,98.247375,7.7405,you know y- you could be working full time and um still be able to work with your child and provide some guidance at home and,2,0
sw3785B-ms98-a,24,B,108.159375,115.99225,7.832875,i say that because you see it reflected in the society at large there are a lot of kids out there who seem more troubled today than they used to be,1,0
sw3785B-ms98-a,41,B,188.48825,201.994875,13.506625,well probably having gone through that experience you'll be likely to want to s- speak with her uh teachers and really try to communicate with them to find out what it is that you can do to help her at home,1,0
sw3785B-ms98-a,45,B,210.48575,220.691875,10.206125, well you know we're coming up on the time she's probably going to be ready for she's in a day care situation now because my husband and i both work full time but um,1,0
sw3785B-ms98-a,46,B,220.691875,229.271875,8.58,i think she'll probably be ready for preschool around three or three and a half and after that time we really do need to think about it because in San Francisco,1,0
sw3785B-ms98-a,47,B,229.271875,241.996125,12.72425,in our neighborhood there's actually a good public schools at the elementary grade there's not a really decent middle school or high school i'm not sure we'll be in the same area when she's that old but um ,1,0
sw3786A-ms98-a,4,A,13.436125,18.683375,5.24725, well any stay any place that long they got to be doing something right right,1,0
sw3786A-ms98-a,13,A,70.6555,77.84775,7.19225,right well no it didn't necessarily say other than salary but what would you consider to be kind of important i guess,1,0
sw3786B-ms98-a,10,B,52.195625,57.620125,5.4245,i'm not sure what the category's supposed to be uh but it was what,1,0
sw3786B-ms98-a,44,B,263.449625,275.28475,11.835125,yeah well i'm sure you know if you were being paid a slave labor scale obviously money would be high up on the list but,1,0
sw3787A-ms98-a,34,A,166.551,179.47125,12.92025,we stopped and i sort of did it myself year before last then this last summer i'd went back to a service and then went but went to a new service and they appear to have be doing a better job,1,0
sw3788B-ms98-a,18,B,109.3865,116.1405,6.754,you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard and unfortunately they are not,1,0
sw3790A-ms98-a,7,A,29.7765,33.902,4.1255,i just i hope they can give them_1 a game i think it'll be a good game this year but,1,0
sw3790A-ms98-a,14,A,63.498625,75.414125,11.9155,and so a lot of people like the 49ers because_1 Steve Young plays for them uh Jim McMahon plays for the Chicago Bears so they cheered for him you know when he played for them but he kind of got to be a jerk so nobody liked him anyway but,1,0
sw3790A-ms98-a,24,A,110.65525,122.81375,12.1585,oh yeah well i think i think you'll see i bet in the nineties they come out and i'll bet they're the team to beat is i mean they got so many first and second round picks again this year that i think they're gonna be really tough and Jimmy Johnson ,1,0
sw3790A-ms98-a,66,A,284.044375,294.287375,10.243,oh really that'll be interesting see i know uh he's he been recruited pretty heavily he's not sure if he wants to follow in his brother's footsteps and go to the Y i wouldn't do it if i were him,1,0
sw3790B-ms98-a,36,B,98.041875,102.959625,4.91775,used to be the Cow- i mean the Cowboys f- f- for so many years uh ended up ,1,0
sw3790B-ms98-a,44,B,131.351,137.65775,6.30675,you know it's one thing to be a real successful college coach now i i at least i imagine it is um you know an- and then,1,0
sw3790B-ms98-a,45,B,137.65775,141.754125,4.096375, it seem like it would be quite different to to be coaching pros,2,0
sw3790B-ms98-a,48,B,148.75175,160.959875,12.208125, course course also at that at that level i mean you're dealing with people who who who know you know who who are competitive obviously or they wouldn't be there and they're motivated obviously   wouldn't be there you know,2,0
sw3790B-ms98-a,61,B,216.146625,228.927125,12.7805,you know they they look like they were b- you know they're kind of like the Cowboys i mean  for years years had a dominating team then they went through this big long  slump and and uh last year it looked like they were back and and there was predictions that they were gonna be a,1,0
sw3790B-ms98-a,62,B,228.927125,239.991625,11.0645,you know it'll be real challenge in fact i think they started ranks like you know fifteenth in the polls or some- and then you know then it was a long slide down it really was i- a fairly disappointing year,1,0
sw3790B-ms98-a,73,B,277.981375,285.94575,7.964375,right and and supposedly uh uh his brother his younger brother is graduating supposedly his younger brother is supposed to be a lot better than he is yeah,1,0
sw3791A-ms98-a,2,A,0.019,4.844375,4.825375,oh so what would be the your favorite meal to cook,1,0
sw3791A-ms98-a,45,A,117.6315,127.90075,10.26925,delicious no no the times i've been out deer hunting i- i- i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa,1,0
sw3791B-ms98-a,9,B,32.1685,36.604,4.4355,so i guess it's supposed to be dinner party is that what they said,1,0
sw3792A-ms98-a,24,A,60.9755,74.2265,13.251,well mainly because it's just uh at this point in life i've had to be available to travel and we live in an apartment right now so um they're not even allowed here ,1,0
sw3793A-ms98-a,68,A,229.563625,238.16275,8.599125,it i- it would be fun to go camping up there again i haven't been up to Yosemite for God i don't know how many years i would love to go up there again,1,0
sw3793B-ms98-a,47,B,159.02925,162.604125,3.574875,tends to be a good place for us to get away sometimes,1,0
sw3793B-ms98-a,71,B,275.9625,289.41925,13.45675,put themselves   they could find a spot so you go to bed at night and have a few people around you a- wake up in the morning and just be surrounded  there were no limitations in other words to the campsite there were people everywhere,1,0
sw3794A-ms98-a,37,A,131.269,140.266875,8.997875,uh no he used to be he he's a retired attorney now uh but he was the uh he was uh uh,1,0
sw3795A-ms98-a,43,A,153.385125,164.823375,11.43825,that's good if nothing else they've got the gangs pushed down to where they're  you know not going to be very active at least as far as you know murders or open crimes are concerned,1,0
sw3795A-ms98-a,47,A,190.5495,199.4775,8.928, and it's as though they're really trying to push to make sure they go down the toilet lot of pe- lot of institutions  they seem to be fighting against family,1,0
sw3795A-ms98-a,51,A,214.974875,225.23625,10.261375, yeah well to a certain extent it can be traced back there  and and and that's okay to say so as long as you understand that you got to forgive,1,0
sw3795B-ms98-a,37,B,198.982625,211.3415,12.358875, seems to be that way i seems like everybody that  we've heard of or know that  go for any kind of psych- psychiatric help  uh every problem you've got is blamed on your parents,1,0
sw3796A-ms98-a,21,A,128.6115,141.951875,13.340375,i think that'll be real interesting to see what they can do they're ahead and the Lakers are down i guess in fourth uh position in the west and i don't know in the east i don't know uh is it Boston in uh first place,1,0
sw3796A-ms98-a,46,A,267.518,278.244,10.726,well i think you're right and i think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit and i think those things do make a difference and there are  marquee players and i think i think Jordan and the and the Bulls have to be,1,0
sw3796A-ms98-a,47,A,278.244,287.756125,9.512125, uh considered the likely favorites i don't know who would meet them in the west um i don't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year they were so disappointing,1,0
sw3796B-ms98-a,34,B,188.7165,199.08675,10.37025,they're really i mean not a whole lot you know i mean  you find them_1 they're  find them_1 be to be pretty loyal uh you know w- with the local teams,2,0
sw3797A-ms98-a,24,A,169.27,180.082625,10.812625,oh i don't know i've lived here since seventy four Howard and i d- i think i think they been working on the highways around here since i've been here and i think they'll i think they'll be working on them_1 long after my wife and i are gone,1,0
sw3797B-ms98-a,39,B,209.570375,223.955125,14.38475, course it was designed for most of us to go about forty five miles an hour because the short on ramps and -/off] off ramps but  gosh seems like uh those ramps might kill us yet i hopefully the new ones will be a lot better,1,0
sw3797B-ms98-a,50,B,287.40975,295.257375,7.847625,i don't know it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier it may be all in my mind ,1,0
sw3798A-ms98-a,65,A,196.2905,204.9835,8.693,yeah  i mean i- i definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed but as you say um ,1,0
sw3798B-ms98-a,6,B,27.630625,37.424,9.793375,um because_1 i think it's something that's gonna take them_1 a while to come up with a uh vaccine for i don't think it's gonna be that easy to come up with or i think they already would have by now you know,1,0
sw3798B-ms98-a,31,B,160.960125,169.891,8.930875,and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything  and uh i don't know i don't think that's a bad idea,1,0
sw3798B-ms98-a,33,B,176.345,182.030125,5.685125, but um i don't know at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS so far cannot be,2,0
sw3798B-ms98-a,43,B,230.085375,234.117375,4.032,if you solve one problem you may be creating another  you know,1,0
sw3799B-ms98-a,26,B,81.76425,87.200125,5.435875,really interesting being able to do that on the computer they were surprised at how much could be done,1,0
sw3799B-ms98-a,32,B,110.093,113.794375,3.701375,you should be able to get some work that way,1,0
sw3799B-ms98-a,36,B,126.1965,130.11375,3.91725,yeah you really you have to be a little more selective,1,0
sw3799B-ms98-a,39,B,138.303875,146.51175,8.207875,there might even be cottage industries now listed in the newspaper because_1 that's what it ends up being a cottage industry,1,0
sw3800A-ms98-a,7,A,17.97575,24.21075,6.235, it's i work at a at a financial institution and seen quite a bit used to be a loan officer and,1,0
sw3800B-ms98-a,9,B,52.497875,65.98975,13.491875,yes they they uh they used to be uh uh more credit conscious i think the credit card companies now with with interest rates as high as they are they don't have to be as credit conscious they can,2,0
sw3801A-ms98-a,14,A,48.045625,53.835375,5.78975,oh my that's that's got to be a frightening way to s- spend an evening,1,0
sw3801A-ms98-a,30,A,139.260875,142.373375,3.1125,that's that couldn't be too far from you neither uh,1,0
sw3801A-ms98-a,36,A,163.207875,167.71,4.502125,i don't know uh how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody but,1,0
sw3801A-ms98-a,42,A,190.752375,196.243875,5.4915,i think you're right uh although i think that may be an excuse for people too,1,0
sw3801B-ms98-a,15,B,63.213625,70.712625,7.499,and walked to the you know through the house into the garage there was no one there but i wanted to be sure,1,0
sw3802B-ms98-a,12,B,68.96225,73.894,4.93175,but it's there they can be black holes to throw money into ,1,0
sw3802B-ms98-a,19,B,143.09225,157.670875,14.578625,well it's a lot of fun i think um just from the standpoint of  getting away from the dodge here and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation,1,0
sw3802B-ms98-a,28,B,202.447375,204.598625,2.15125,yeah that would be fun,1,0
sw3802B-ms98-a,30,B,205.71875,219.216375,13.497625, i've just never  i've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat um once i get my son into and through with college he's gonna be starting uh Rice next year so he's going off but,1,0
sw3803A-ms98-a,7,A,69.196625,75.896875,6.70025,or i don't know whether this could be something that was done in school but somehow people,1,0
sw3803B-ms98-a,11,B,55.714625,65.286875,9.57225,  specific use in other words if they just wanted to have a a gun to have in their home uh you wouldn't you wouldn't like them to be able to do that is that,1,0
sw3803B-ms98-a,18,B,102.03075,110.2175,8.18675,um that may be wrong um you know i mean certainly there there are cases of of you know the children who find their parents' gun or something and and,1,0
sw3803B-ms98-a,19,B,110.2175,117.675,7.4575,shoot a brother or sister or you know things like that that need to be definitely avoided and that's that's certainly within the channels right,1,0
sw3803B-ms98-a,30,B,179.02375,184.377375,5.353625,waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem you know and and things i don't know i've,1,0

sw3805A-ms98-a,35,A,225.67025,240.394,14.72375,i think you know it's gonna be really painful so the question is how soon are we gonna start to get our money's worth and as you said it's how soon we get involved and i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look,1,0
sw3805A-ms98-a,45,A,290.397375,299.554,9.156625, well you may be right  what i think is really gonna be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it and i and i think it is what you say it's it's a,2,0
sw3806A-ms98-a,40,A,116.644,119.668625,3.024625,he'll be ravenously hungry by then ,1,0

sw3807A-ms98-a,80,A,293.979625,296.9335,2.953875,that should be really fun to to watch,1,0
sw3807B-ms98-a,105,B,289.9495,292.400125,2.450625,that ought to be fun,1,0
sw3808A-ms98-a,55,A,220.002625,228.77475,8.772125,uh-huh is there some concern that the tests may not be completely accurate that you might be taking some prescription medication and and,2,0
sw3808A-ms98-a,56,A,228.77475,230.976875,2.202125,be interpreted correctly,1,0
sw3808A-ms98-a,70,A,289.119875,295.917,6.797125,there's a chance they're going to be tested you think they'd be smart enough if they did have a problem to eliminate   ,2,0
sw3808B-ms98-a,19,B,90.39325,92.486,2.09275,uh seems to be,1,0
sw3808B-ms98-a,57,B,236.851,240.28675,3.43575,third party and there's supposed to be a lot of safe guards and all that,1,0
sw3808B-ms98-a,64,B,264.45175,278.84475,14.393,yeah if you're if you're you're high you know if you fail the test whatever reason you have to go in into a program and uh course that can be very quickly taken care of if you're not a habitual user or whatever,1,0
sw3809A-ms98-a,18,A,113.28075,120.610625,7.329875,or carrying the same job responsibility and you know i that's a very true statement and it shouldn't uh it shouldn't be that way,1,0
sw3809A-ms98-a,32,A,177.808375,184.09375,6.285375,and i think if in the future it's even gonna be uh more noticeable and more significant,1,0
sw3809B-ms98-a,12,B,89.285,100.731375,11.446375,so that that's a i think that's a change and i think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing ,1,0
sw3809B-ms98-a,25,B,185.5935,200.177625,14.584125,yeah i- i think it will be i think i well an- another thing i read too the other day this is not just for working women but how much they're out there i guess is that car designers um are starting to design cars with women in mind,1,0

sw3811A-ms98-a,24,A,89.086625,93.80025,4.713625,certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class,1,0

sw3811B-ms98-a,32,B,118.339875,131.544,13.204125,um to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were gonna be loving and uh  that's more important than anything else we could have sent uh her to a fancier,2,0
sw3811B-ms98-a,60,B,279.86775,288.534625,8.666875,uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life,1,0

sw3815A-ms98-a,46,A,201.89975,212.740625,10.840875,well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one and i thought it would be more reliable,1,0
sw3815A-ms98-a,48,A,214.8355,227.683375,12.847875, i found that out  i mean you know the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when you went in to and they asked and said that was the requirement,1,0
sw3816A-ms98-a,14,A,44.632625,48.656875,4.02425,yeah that that'd be fun that'd be a lot of fun,2,0
sw3816A-ms98-a,16,A,50.54275,60.88,10.33725,that's true yeah i'd i'd have to i'd think once or twice but i think i'd probably do it just for the experience i guess but it'd be pretty interesting that's for sure ,1,0
sw3816A-ms98-a,22,A,74.523375,78.23325,3.709875,you think it'll ever happen where they'll let it'll be common or,1,0
sw3816A-ms98-a,33,A,102.2515,112.331875,10.080375,yeah i'm i'm kind of anxious to see what they do with this uh uh this space station they're talking about you know i think that'd be  a step to where you know in the right direction but ,1,0
sw3816A-ms98-a,54,A,188.352,192.08825,3.73625,there could be some val- i guess there's a shuttle going up tomorrow as far as i,1,0
sw3816B-ms98-a,10,B,39.573625,51.229375,11.65575,well i don't know i just it would be something i've never experienced before weightlessness i'd love to experience weightlessness that's something i've always uh thought would be fascinating you know,2,0
sw3816B-ms98-a,15,B,59.198,73.028,13.83,when they had the uh accident you know ba- the space shuttle accident and i thought well maybe i won't go you  but uh since then i thought well what the heck i'd go if it would be a one ti- once in lifetime experience i'd try it,1,0
sw3816B-ms98-a,60,B,215.54125,221.186,5.64475,i th- i think they'll work it out eventually yeah like you say it will be a major breakthrough right now they're sort of,1,0
sw3816B-ms98-a,68,B,264.114125,275.164125,11.05,yeah and they were trying to figure out how to solve that problem if they were planning on going to Mars because you know it would be a real long term talking about a couple of years i guess,1,0
sw3817A-ms98-a,46,A,232.03925,237.51375,5.4745,there's got to be a few of those second does that make second cousin or third cousin i'm not sure,1,0
sw3817A-ms98-a,51,A,249.353375,254.77025,5.416875,so perhaps my grandparents siblings would be my great great,1,0
sw3817B-ms98-a,11,B,65.831625,77.914625,12.083, actually he was not he has gone  but they decided to go ahead and take the family reunion back that far so that it wouldn't just be people meeting third cousins but people meeting i guess,1,0
sw3817B-ms98-a,32,B,199.451625,207.427125,7.9755,sometimes when you've moved perhaps your family reunion if there ever one would would be back in Michigan i mean that would be where your roots would be ,3,0
sw3817B-ms98-a,44,B,254.7515,260.2125,5.461,they'd just be your great-aunts great-aunt your grandparents' siblings would be your great aunts and uncles,2,0
sw3818A-ms98-a,53,A,173.90425,175.39225,1.488,i'll be,1,0
sw3818A-ms98-a,58,A,186.924625,192.123875,5.19925,yeah that would that would really be upsetting with me too if my neighbors didn't like my dogs you know,1,0
sw3818A-ms98-a,76,A,260.99675,268.66825,7.6715,well that's a shame you know and you c- i know you can have their barker taken out but who'd want to do that that would be awful,1,0
sw3819A-ms98-a,18,A,78.06525,87.961125,9.895875,it's gonna bring very good things and uh we're going to be a lot better off as a society as it continues but it's a painful transition ,1,0
sw3819A-ms98-a,36,A,202.188625,208.641,6.452375,that's really gonna be better for everybody but a lot of people are threatened by that as is reflected in what goes on ,1,0
sw3819B-ms98-a,8,B,21.45975,27.562375,6.102625,because it used to be strictly male and the views on it used to be strictly male ,2,0
sw3819B-ms98-a,33,B,213.718375,224.56025,10.841875,but you'd be surprised the majority of the people that are against women going into the work force doing you know even jobs you know on an even keel with men ,1,0
sw3819B-ms98-a,35,B,232.333875,239.165375,6.8315,i mean the women have these ideas that they got to be the little home makers and they have to stay at home or they're not doing good you know a good job,1,0
sw3820A-ms98-a,29,A,161.96875,170.838125,8.869375,we at least for part of our trip will be visiting someone and uh even when my wife is well,1,0
sw3820A-ms98-a,46,A,243.951375,252.71675,8.765375,it really makes a difference because i know even when we went to China when we crossed the border we went over to Hong Kong we were so relieved it was so fun to be uh,1,0
sw3821A-ms98-a,44,A,153.43775,155.569125,2.131375, you'll be thirty three this year,1,0

sw3821B-ms98-a,17,B,74.7665,81.761125,6.994625,yeah and it you know i mean they they're just a convenience for me i don't have to get cash out of the  and i don't have to to be writing checks and and uh ,1,0
sw3822A-ms98-a,11,A,28.80525,30.678,1.87275,to be but,1,0
sw3822B-ms98-a,46,B,165.912625,169.830875,3.91825,if i could solve problems i'd be a rich person but guess i can't,1,0
sw3822B-ms98-a,53,B,203.847375,208.372375,4.525,you got to be careful if i mean i never had a problem i mean i'm not like,1,0
sw3822B-ms98-a,54,B,208.372375,214.731125,6.35875,h- just you just don't hang out in Dallas or you got to be you know where not to be at night and the you know,2,0
sw3823A-ms98-a,7,A,28.34725,32.52225,4.175,well the screen still has a hole in  so don't be too impressed,1,0
sw3823B-ms98-a,38,B,232.53025,245.98225,13.452,cooler weather and then we sold our   and i never i always hope that the owners didn't have the same problem next year it's all those things that you don't necessarily want to tell them i don't know i mean we weren't trying to be dishonest or anything you just ,1,0
sw3824A-ms98-a,88,A,258.02575,267.255875,9.230125,business mindedness in uh you know in government and stuff and some of those in same business philosophies and it will be interesting to see how she does because,1,0
sw3824A-ms98-a,94,A,290.674875,293.95325,3.278375,yeah it will be a lot it will be interesting to see how she does the you know there's,2,0
sw3824B-ms98-a,36,B,134.1985,147.17475,12.97625,no but uh it's too bad uh but i think it's like a lot of things whether it's a company or an organization of some kind or the g- federal government it's uh it gets to be too big and uh it controls uh,1,0
sw3825A-ms98-a,14,A,81.515875,89.271625,7.75575,um assign a different person each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody,1,0
sw3825B-ms98-a,49,B,274.981875,284.87125,9.889375,who would be somewhere in in West Virginia i'm sure she's you know dead now because my grandmother died in about twenty years ago,1,0
sw3826A-ms98-a,28,A,133.31575,139.767125,6.451375,but it sure will be interesting to see how see it once i do figure out what all the controversy's about ,1,0
sw3826B-ms98-a,13,B,57.499,63.136625,5.637625,uh eight to eleven which used to be eight o'clock at night till eleven o'clock at night now to seven to ten,1,0
sw3826B-ms98-a,39,B,215.446125,224.85,9.403875,it's gonna be real interesting to see where we go with all of the selective channels that people are going to be able to get via cable television and computer services,2,0
sw3827A-ms98-a,6,A,30.853375,39.8955,9.042125,we've recently made a move i used to be at the university where there's facilities there and my wife and i regularly played um racquetball,1,0
sw3827A-ms98-a,23,A,126.574125,138.172,11.597875,i j- i haven't been here uh uh only for several months and uh i- i'm sure that there must be some cooperation between the departments but uh i'm not aware of anything as yet,1,0
sw3827A-ms98-a,31,A,157.44925,170.28625,12.837,from the university so i often will walk in which i guess it's i'm not sure how far it is um actually it's twenty five minutes and it's probably about a m- i don't know l- it's got to be maybe a ,1,0
sw3827A-ms98-a,48,A,253.92375,260.27925,6.3555,yeah if i were to be- to begin exercise now i think it'd be something that i could do um,2,0
sw3827B-ms98-a,8,B,47.20375,59.91175,12.708,well that sort of same sort of thing happened to me i used to be a regular swimmer i i taught at a university and i you know could use the pool  every day if i wanted and since moving away from the university environment i've uh,1,0
sw3828A-ms98-a,7,A,40.723,55.626,14.903,a a criminal today not a murderer but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things and you know he does this and he does this for a couple of years hides all the stash and works off of it and then when he gets caught he'll be sentenced,1,0
sw3828A-ms98-a,8,A,55.626,68.7015,13.0755,something like five to seven years but he gets five days credit for every day he serves i mean it's like a bonus to go to jail so subsequently a five year sentence means he's going be out in uh a year,1,0
sw3828A-ms98-a,16,A,120.187375,127.71525,7.527875,well it it certainly is and uh that would be a huge concern you know i don't think the general public really realizes this,1,0
sw3828A-ms98-a,25,A,180.780625,190.5745,9.793875,l- let him live for years and years and  years before you do execute him or whatever because_1 it's has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him and you know to,1,0
sw3828B-ms98-a,4,B,7.275625,13.053875,5.77825,think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people ,1,0

sw3829B-ms98-a,5,B,20.5,27.995375,7.495375,yeah well actually the past couple days has made me want to get out there and get started but  i figure i'd just be wasting my time,1,0

sw3831A-ms98-a,14,A,73.244625,86.714875,13.47025,and amazingly we we had those weapons that would counteract those missiles so that they would do a minimal of damage uh the whole thing was very amazing to me i don't think any any of it is right i mean we should be doing any of that stuff  ,1,0
sw3831A-ms98-a,17,A,108.617625,116.594,7.976375,Arafat and the and the the P L O and everything would just you know be so rambunctious as to just,1,0

sw3832B-ms98-a,53,B,146.028875,153.22775,7.198875,yeah but soon it'll be time to go out and put some bulbs i get enthusiastic in the spring and then it kind of dies down,1,0
sw3833A-ms98-a,49,A,172.60525,183.465875,10.860625,yeah that would be interesting to do um i worked for a trucking company so we didn't really even have to dress up at all if we didn't want to we could wear pants all the time you know,1,0
sw3833B-ms98-a,65,B,223.198,225.633125,2.435125,so i have to be careful about reds,1,0

sw3835A-ms98-a,16,A,40.46,46.15975,5.69975,well i was thinking now that would be a good place to exchange a recipe maybe  um,1,0
sw3835B-ms98-a,16,B,52.5805,54.544375,1.963875,oh that's going to be easy,1,0

sw3836A-ms98-a,12,A,79.545,86.388,6.843,and it'd probably be cheaper to go ahead and pay a percentage of the local plan,1,0
sw3836A-ms98-a,24,A,151.849125,159.375125,7.526,i i i don't mean to be ugly about it but uh costs of dental work are pretty high,1,0
sw3836A-ms98-a,25,A,159.375125,171.970375,12.59525,and if there's something i don't necessarily think it needs to be driven down again but to keep it from shooting up of course dentistry i don't think has near the problem with like malpractice insurance and such,1,0
sw3836A-ms98-a,27,A,179.801875,187.435625,7.63375,it seems to be the burden of proof that on the doctor that he didn't do something wrong rather than proving that he did,1,0
sw3836B-ms98-a,19,B,119.1835,128.68775,9.50425,and uh physicians i think may be facing the same situation except they apparently have a very strong,1,0

sw3843A-ms98-a,7,A,15.187625,24.67525,9.487625,you know it needs to be somewhat equitable i guess as far as the number of people that are affected uh cancer seems to affect a lot more people and you'd think they need to spend more on that but,1,0
sw3843A-ms98-a,48,A,146.5585,155.63575,9.07725,yeah yeah that's true i mean that you might that you want to try and be charitable but yet you got to take care of your own house and put your own house in order before you start dishing out to everybody else and,1,0
sw3843A-ms98-a,58,A,181.21975,190.383375,9.163625,and and like i say what do we really get out of it a lot of times you know  i guess if we didn't help the Soviet Union there could be just total chaos and go back to the old order but ,1,0
sw3843A-ms98-a,89,A,280.472875,286.353125,5.88025,that is it's and i say i don't have any idea how much and there ought to be probably a lot more spent to,1,0
sw3843B-ms98-a,47,B,220.622875,222.859375,2.2365,but there really should just be more,1,0

sw3851A-ms98-a,63,A,212.512125,215.9245,3.412375,which in a way i think it it could be a little bad but,1,0
sw3851B-ms98-a,45,B,176.05225,183.089625,7.037375,and there's there's a lot of interest in that of course if you put in too much money you have to have a pretty good idea as to what your medical expenses are going to be for the year,1,0

sw3854A-ms98-a,45,A,283.653875,286.996,3.342125,it'd be great to know we didn't have to pay five hundred dollars or whatever,1,0
sw3857B-ms98-a,9,B,17.2005,21.471125,4.270625,different nationalities there's going to be a different section for each nationality,1,0

sw3859A-ms98-a,26,A,142.326375,157.253875,14.9275,yeah and i think that's just too tough in a on a uh uh you know a guy i m- you got to be real real savvy to do that and i don't see Kelley as being that savvy i don't i think that's one of the weaknesses in the Buffalo offense myself,1,0
sw3859B-ms98-a,1,B,0,5.76675,5.76675, all right uh yeah not as much as i used to be i- i grew up in Pittsburgh and,1,0
sw3859B-ms98-a,43,B,188.894125,203.69925,14.805125,i was thinking maybe they uh ought to just AFC ought to just give it up and uh when uh it comes time for the Super Bowl the NFC champ plays an all star team of the AFC teams that might be a little more interesting because_1 i'm getting a little tired of watching the blowouts in the uh,1,0
sw3859B-ms98-a,54,B,245.472125,256.9065,11.434375,but uh i guess they're gonna somebody was saying uh s- i was watching the game with some people they were saying that instant replay may be on its way out i guess they have enough votes to uh or not enough votes to keep it going,1,0
sw3860A-ms98-a,38,A,237.008125,243.284125,6.276,you know really special care and i think that would what be what i would desire if if i had to one of those,1,0
sw3860B-ms98-a,9,B,62.463875,71.1875,8.723625,and he was very concerned that uh mother be provided for so he went through a process over a period of about five years,1,0
sw3860B-ms98-a,10,B,71.1875,73.6465,2.459,deciding where he wanted to be,1,0
sw3861B-ms98-a,10,B,25.695,32.9255,7.2305,well to be honest they didn't really do a lot i mean my dad sat me down i guess in junior high and said,1,0
sw3861B-ms98-a,12,B,44.41075,56.637125,12.226375,you're going to college and you're going to graduate school so decide now what do you want to be  here here are your choices you can be a doctor a lawyer an architect uh he gave me a list of choices all you know,2,0
sw3861B-ms98-a,16,B,68.759,75.704625,6.945625,i didn't think i'd be a very good architect because i like to draw but not that way so i said well i guess i'll be a lawyer because i think they help people ,2,0
sw3861B-ms98-a,18,B,77.143125,79.52775,2.384625,so Dad said okay fine you're going to be a lawyer,1,0
sw3861B-ms98-a,28,B,137.297,149.289375,11.992375,and they told me that i was provisionally accepted but that if that they got a black person or Hispanic person or something that was qualified from this area that i would be bumped because i'm just a basic you know ,1,0
sw3862A-ms98-a,17,A,52.700875,57.500875,4.8,gets to th- to a point where she needs special care that i'll be able to,1,0
sw3862B-ms98-a,48,B,229.757875,236.582125,6.82425,and they may be ambulatory but they tend to behave like children small children,1,0
sw3862B-ms98-a,49,B,236.582125,246.507875,9.92575,and that would be very difficult i think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to ha- to have to deal with on a daily basis,1,0
sw3863A-ms98-a,10,A,32.83675,40.257625,7.420875,and uh now that i'm i retired about uh not quite a month ago that'll be uh i guess uh most of my efforts,1,0
sw3864A-ms98-a,6,A,24.845625,28.280625,3.435,and it'll be a while before they're an economic threat for sure,1,0
sw3864A-ms98-a,10,A,47.740375,57.5185,9.778125, do you think that if their economy were in a better condition that they would be a threat uh that given their political changes they would still be a threat or,2,0
sw3864A-ms98-a,30,A,143.42175,151.776625,8.354875,skimming  the top you know especially the government but um it's gonna be awhile before the people adopt the philosophy that,1,0
sw3864A-ms98-a,37,A,185.25275,196.57375,11.321,and and almost um the philosophy has been put in as little as you can because you know that the same results will will be there at the end so  spend the extra energy,1,0
sw3864A-ms98-a,51,A,261.033125,271.717875,10.68475,uh strategic assistance from other countries i'll i'll be curious to see what happens in this elections because it doesn't seem as though that's forth coming right now um,1,0
sw3864A-ms98-a,55,A,282.597375,293.698,11.100625,great interest in that area now he's gonna be accused of not spending enough time on the domestic issues you know certainly foreign issues are his strength  so it's a catch twenty two ,1,0
sw3864B-ms98-a,6,B,27.859,39.203625,11.344625,it seems that way sometimes you wonder if um an economic threat isn't gonna drive people to do things that would be more drastic than if uh they were a little bit more peaceful you know,1,0

sw3873B-ms98-a,41,B,280.33525,285.10525,4.77,there needs to be more emphasis on some of your basic education,1,0

sw3877B-ms98-a,5,B,33.99325,46.646375,12.653125,but i don't think that you can until Troy loses the job on his own merits i think the job has to be his now that he's healthy again now if he doesn't perform then i guess the other guy is waiting to step in the wings,1,0

sw3884A-ms98-a,35,A,209.0755,218.7935,9.718,um-hum  and uh that would be s- a school that the parents uh should seek out for their uh students if they're interested in that that field and,1,0
sw3884A-ms98-a,36,A,218.7935,232.411,13.6175,and where it's well known uh the word gets out and that that might be a a case where even if it was out of state and they had to pay a little higher tuition then it would be well worth the the uh to to go to to Penn State,2,0
sw3884A-ms98-a,42,A,261.4365,269.55025,8.11375,um-hum  well that's very important in in a choice of a college or university that they look at those aspects uh wherever they might be,1,0
sw3884A-ms98-a,44,A,273.87875,285.788125,11.909375,but th- they need to know about the the costs and uh how they're going to be able to pay for this whether they can get students loans or  are their parents are able to help or whatever but uh,1,0
sw3884B-ms98-a,20,B,129.63825,135.533,5.89475,that means that the quality of what he was taught must be  very very high,1,0
sw3884B-ms98-a,29,B,202.716625,210.31825,7.601625,high class research we must be well trained and and uh available to teach the students well,1,0
sw3885A-ms98-a,4,A,5.523125,12.91475,7.391625,it's a it's a difficult question i don't know that i uh can easily come up with an answer to what can be done,1,0
sw3885A-ms98-a,13,A,34.8365,42.035375,7.198875,be better or wou- would decrease or would increase if there were some changes in the way drugs are legislated i don't know if,1,0
sw3885A-ms98-a,42,A,162.32025,174.922375,12.602125,no no but you know as a child we were able to uh ride our bikes around the neighborhood and go to our friends and those are things that i'm not sure i'd be comfortable with when she gets to bike riding age you know,1,0
sw3885B-ms98-a,62,B,249.72,254.4635,4.7435,sure i- and it's so frightening because you have to teach them to be scared all the time,1,0
sw3885B-ms98-a,64,B,255.45875,257.284625,1.825875,and to really be cautious,1,0
sw3885B-ms98-a,66,B,258.899125,270.04825,11.149125,well they don't know any other way they don't know any other way i mean they weren't raised when i was when you didn't worry about that everyone worries about that now so they just assume that you'll always have to be on your guard,1,0
sw3886A-ms98-a,12,A,45.5685,51.34825,5.77975,but that would be nice to have uh um you kn- all is it an all news uh radio station,1,0
sw3886B-ms98-a,13,B,78.273125,84.14175,5.868625,especially in Austin come to think of it uh that you're going to be able to get it down there uh,1,0

sw3887A-ms98-a,16,A,69.823875,79.62175,9.797875,you know i- i think seems to think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories,1,0
sw3887B-ms98-a,36,B,235.9555,249.930125,13.974625,set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it and uh we're going to feel it and i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a,2,0
sw3888A-ms98-a,71,A,230.87825,240.363125,9.484875,on top of this or at least instrumental in trying to do something that nothing is really going to be done by private industry until they you know get that push it really wasn't done in our country,1,0
sw3888B-ms98-a,12,B,63.493,74.927375,11.434375,you know the the the way that the air masses move around the the sea coast uh and it really just like making and stuff just hang over whatever cities happen to be on the coast,1,0
sw3888B-ms98-a,29,B,173.7155,182.567125,8.851625,which you know  that's  kind of going to be the end result you know Bu- i was reading in the Wall Street Journal today you know Bush's moratorium on regulatory,1,0
sw3889B-ms98-a,6,B,14.3495,23.916125,9.566625,the blouse was uh supposed to be a size six but the shoulder drooped over my  and it wasn't you know the style of the blouse it just,1,0
sw3889B-ms98-a,27,B,166.668125,174.4685,7.800375,and i said and that's not that's not the cause of the imbalance i said i just have to be more careful how i put my clothes in,1,0
sw3889B-ms98-a,34,B,225.586,234.140375,8.554375,uh charges for different things i don't know but it seems to me a service call would be kind of universal for anything,1,0
sw3890B-ms98-a,21,B,81.417875,94.491625,13.07375,yeah it sure did because they were they had a real good start and then and then and then ended up you know they they're they're holding on but it's not it's not going to be a  a season like they had last year when they went to the NCAA ,1,0
sw3891A-ms98-a,5,A,22.421125,24.5785,2.157375,oh yeah that'll be nice,1,0
sw3891B-ms98-a,4,B,8.3735,17.9925,9.619,a few minor repairs but i haven't bought anything of any consequences other than clothes and things and i will be in the very near future i'm gonna be buying a big computer and,2,0
sw3891B-ms98-a,7,B,29.9205,37.7945,7.874,i- i- i try to be very careful when i pick up something and and look it over to make sure that it looks like it's   to work,1,0
sw3891B-ms98-a,25,B,123.69175,137.23475,13.543,that's right and and and that's been really um way it's been for me for the last five or six years tha- i returned a TV set to be repaired but the problem was that uh we had a a lightning storm and,1,0
sw3892A-ms98-a,34,A,121.834375,125.9575,4.123125,but um it would be fun to learn how to do a few of those things,1,0
sw3892A-ms98-a,42,A,169.170125,177.529125,8.359,you know she made her own curtains and and i would love to be able to do all of that but i don't feel that i have quite the knack that she does,1,0
sw3892A-ms98-a,44,A,185.2725,196.4285,11.156,if if i- i don't want to spend all the time and money and not and then feel like it looks real cheaply done or or you know not be satisfied with it,1,0
sw3893A-ms98-a,11,A,45.10325,48.21675,3.1135,you must you must be pretty handy,1,0

sw3893B-ms98-a,7,B,47.265875,53.7645,6.498625,well uh i'm fairly good at it not not not enough to be professional or anything but i can do my own,1,0
sw3894A-ms98-a,13,A,70.1975,82.80025,12.60275,yeah i- i really do think that i think the first thing that we need to do and it it would be a hard uh a hard uh medicine uh for everybody to swallow but i think we're gonna have to eventually balance the budget or we're gonna sink,1,0
sw3894B-ms98-a,19,B,91.75975,100.326,8.56625,there are lot of things we don't we don't need to be subsidizing tobacco farmers we don't need to be subsidizing water rights for people who are wealthy fa- i mean basically,2,0
sw3894B-ms98-a,35,B,203.077375,217.4405,14.363125,in retraining programs for these poor people who really kind of went through school and got an high school education and thought they'd be able to at least function in a competitive marketplace or went through college or or went out into the marketplace and,1,0
sw3894B-ms98-a,42,B,263.6055,275.561875,11.956375,okay and my point is hey wait a minute something's wrong here these people are claiming this is the best well if it's the best then it should be translated right on down the line and the general i mean how long has Harvard been around,1,0
sw3896A-ms98-a,41,A,210.036375,221.696875,11.6605,well they have those steppers in President's although i haven't i haven't used one of them but i do see people on them and they they're supposed to be really really really a great uh workout,1,0
sw3896B-ms98-a,25,B,106.438875,114.322125,7.88325,schedule to work working out inside i'd much rather be outside either bicycling or or running or doing that type of thing,1,0
sw3896B-ms98-a,36,B,161.3695,172.146375,10.776875,and so it it uh trying to be a little bit realistic i guess they have the nice scenery like you know uh biking up some mountain road or  like that,1,0
sw3897B-ms98-a,12,B,33.157875,37.237375,4.0795,uh-huh is it going to be over a several day period or was it over sev-,1,0
sw3897B-ms98-a,17,B,48.20925,55.57625,7.367,um-hum well that's kind of nice to be able to do that t- for both occasions my my uh family,1,0
sw3897B-ms98-a,57,B,197.53525,201.021125,3.485875,um-hum oh well that's that would be fun uh-huh,1,0
sw3897B-ms98-a,78,B,289.86875,295.311375,5.442625,oh that would be fu- uh  was that it wa- that wasn't a genealogy book or ,1,0
sw3898A-ms98-a,34,A,140.706625,142.287,1.580375,i'll be darn,1,0
sw3898A-ms98-a,36,A,143.301,149.336625,6.035625,well we're we're supposed to be talking about dining out but i'll just make one comment that uh i just retired from Penn State,1,0
sw3898B-ms98-a,13,B,56.645625,61.154375,4.50875,i think think it might be i've see- i think i've seen it around yes sir yeah,1,0
sw3899A-ms98-a,8,A,38.50225,40.5045,2.00225,yeah i couldn't be-,1,0
sw3899A-ms98-a,21,A,115.179,125.947125,10.768125,um-hum  well you think that they would be able to do that you know i think they could too you know they just  they don't wanna they wanna use uh,1,0
sw3899A-ms98-a,51,A,248.23275,258.387875,10.155125,yeah well uh we have a fireplace here to i don't burn it every night usually i just have mine on the weekends or when i have company that we're gonna be in the house all day,1,0
sw3899A-ms98-a,57,A,282.258,288.08225,5.82425,yeah i know i think it's gonna have to be these large companies and uh-huh,1,0
sw3900A-ms98-a,5,A,10.987625,14.810875,3.82325,yeah i was i was thinking while i was waiting to be connected with uh,1,0
sw3900A-ms98-a,6,A,14.810875,28.169875,13.359,uh another party you know i got real ambivalent uh kind of mixed feelings about it i mean i agree with you i think you know jeez there's an awful lot of money that we go over there to people that  seem to be  uh shall we say less than appreciative,1,0
sw3900B-ms98-a,16,B,155.738125,163.346,7.607875,at least if we are going to be giving them all this money then at least  you know we should get some at least some cooperation or whatever in return,1,0
sw3900B-ms98-a,28,B,230.08175,241.20175,11.12,it's good that i don't know i- it seems slightly more stable now but how long that lasts you know it can history has shown that can just be a lull before the storm,1,0
sw3900B-ms98-a,35,B,285.873875,295.49025,9.616375,hopefully you know optimistically may- maybe something you know i don't think it's all going to be rosy after this latest round of peace talks but hopefully it can be,2,0
sw3902A-ms98-a,27,A,138.19825,143.5295,5.33125,you know where i can go see it i i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado,1,0
sw3902A-ms98-a,57,A,263.43,275.512875,12.082875,and so it's kind of sq- you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations but it something will have to change as more and more of us get older uh luckily if we could be like your grandmother,1,0
sw3902B-ms98-a,5,B,14.835875,17.427375,2.5915,she'll be a hundred and three in August,1,0
sw3902B-ms98-a,25,B,174.753375,181.24175,6.488375,and the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you just practically have we have to be a pauper,1,0
sw3903A-ms98-a,20,A,106.38725,118.619875,12.232625,and a lot of outdoor activities and uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in in Texas i can go skiing with that right now but hopefully i'll be able to get back to the slopes someday so,1,0
sw3903B-ms98-a,24,B,128.109125,140.0515,11.942375,no i never did didn't have the i guess i didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing and of course i was at that you know stage of my life where i had to be taken p- places i couldn't go by myself but,1,0
sw3903B-ms98-a,35,B,205.699625,214.654625,8.955,yeah and my youngest daughter is gonna to be starting up soccer so she's real excited about doing that so we'll we'll be busy with that again,2,0
sw3904A-ms98-a,3,A,24.7355,33.24225,8.50675,well this is getting to be uh similar to the reason i moved away from Saint Louis all these gray gloomy rainy days you know,1,0
sw3905A-ms98-a,54,A,269.02375,281.126125,12.102375,uh i- i don't know ma'am uh i wouldn't be surprised if most of them_1 aren't Japanese parts but uh we've had the Dell computers for four years now and we we're really happy with them,1,0
sw3905B-ms98-a,33,B,193.07425,198.38875,5.3145,and it cannot be repaired and that upset me when i found that out,1,0
sw3906A-ms98-a,3,A,9.05325,12.765625,3.712375,i wonder if we wouldn't be better off um,1,0
sw3906A-ms98-a,41,A,234.941125,238.31175,3.370625, monthly taxes will be as high as your monthly payment,1,0
sw3906B-ms98-a,5,B,24.610125,38.794625,14.1845,i think you're right there uh it might be a little more ruthless uh to go with the free enterprise system the government has a s- sort of a habit of investing in things that don't pay much return,1,0
sw3906B-ms98-a,38,B,209.162875,220.86575,11.702875,uh i think one of my biggest concern on taxes is uh real estate uh taxes down at the local level the federal government seems to be pretty stable you know you can figure out what they're gonna charge you next year,1,0
sw3906B-ms98-a,40,B,225.87075,236.992,11.12125,and i'm just afraid that by the time i'm ready to retire and uh the mortgage is paid off on this house i won't be able to afford the taxes on it,1,0
sw3907A-ms98-a,28,A,159.676875,168.48275,8.805875,Jackie got a hold of a huge box of it so much of it that i dare say that we'll probably still using be using it    ,1,0
sw3908A-ms98-a,25,A,141.017125,149.8045,8.787375,so do you think that is gonna be uh difficult saying as far as uh marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years,1,0
sw3908A-ms98-a,37,A,193.6115,202.288,8.6765,well i actually mo- lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can be brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they're gonna get,1,0
sw3908A-ms98-a,59,A,291.559125,299.522,7.962875,and if they go in the work force they should be treated as nicely as as well as a man or any other person and uh not ,1,0
sw3908B-ms98-a,6,B,43.588,57.398125,13.810125,oh i don't think so i think it's come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities but i still think in lots of job markets they're not treated as equals in the words in some in some respects the other direction that in some job markets they really don't wanna be treated as equals,1,0
sw3908B-ms98-a,18,B,147.46075,157.54125,10.0805,yes yeah and i think also in terms of parenting i think there's gonna be some increasing problem because_1 i think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting and i'm not sure they're becoming any more skilled at it,1,0
sw3908B-ms98-a,23,B,168.484125,175.77625,7.292125,well i- i think one of the things that always happens is i think we'll swing to one end whereas you know where were moving at to the end where a lot of women will be at work,1,0
sw3908B-ms98-a,24,B,175.77625,188.653,12.87675,and then i think we starting to see now some tendency of women at  mid thirties and so i was saying you know this career thing isn't all it's cracked up to be and i wanna go back and do something else so i think we'll probably see this  pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit,1,0
sw3908B-ms98-a,29,B,207.97525,221.501375,13.526125,well i think they ought to have the right i- i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife  to com- and or my wife or my daughter's going into combat but i have problems with men doing that and i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it it's nothing i'd be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for,1,0
sw3908B-ms98-a,37,B,255.839875,264.03,8.190125,well i think one of the other things that concern has concerned me a little bit and i think i see some change in attitudes there my wife happens to be a wife who's chosen to stay at home,1,0
sw3908B-ms98-a,38,B,264.03,274.4845,10.4545,and there's a a te- has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence because if she did she'd be out in the work force uh and fulfilling herself,1,0
sw3909B-ms98-a,33,B,150.835875,161.34175,10.505875,there are some times i think that uh you know the quality of teachers may be improved upon i think what they did a few years ago was kind of a joke about testing the teachers and all,1,0
sw3909B-ms98-a,35,B,167.001625,176.505125,9.5035,the the kind of courses that should be involved in education curriculum and um trying to i- improve upon them uh somewhat but,1,0
sw3909B-ms98-a,36,B,176.505125,190.67425,14.169125, um they've never really paid you know real well and and you know people have to  pick a an occupation that's gonna support themselves it can't be all sacrifice and no you know salary  you got to live on something,1,0
sw3909B-ms98-a,50,B,246.6025,251.722,5.1195,and then other people you know aren't that upset about it and they test very well so there has to be,1,0
sw3909B-ms98-a,53,B,277.17575,289.493875,12.318125,yeah you know uh   i wouldn't wanna be back in school now i think it uh it's a real challenge and you know um i think maybe the kids need more um,1,0
sw3910A-ms98-a,7,A,50.1985,64.982125,14.783625,yeah it seems to uh uh  you know it it's like it's like accents even you know there's not used to be there's a great variation across the US and now with television everybody is beginning to sound like uh a news uh announcer you kn-,1,0
sw3910A-ms98-a,16,A,121.528375,132.16,10.631625,and and until i- i- i guess it would be something that if i had been uh uh a little more educated in it or forced into using it more i might be more comfortable with it,2,0
sw3910A-ms98-a,20,A,157.45775,163.771875,6.314125,well well sure it'd take a new gener- it would take a new generation to be just you know completely metric,1,0
sw3910A-ms98-a,36,A,233.059375,245.149,12.089625,yeah and then and then you could you know people would start loo- seeing a you know a quantity and they would say well hey that you know that's ab- that looks to be about two pounds and hey that's this much you know in metric so you know,1,0
sw3910B-ms98-a,3,B,1.69575,9.23075,7.535,well uh i i was just talking to my dad about that just a couple of weeks ago and i think i think it'd be great that we went to it,1,0
sw3910B-ms98-a,25,B,78.072125,92.383375,14.31125,yeah well i uh i work in a hospital and of course that's all we use and e- and every thing we do is metric you know and uh you know weights is in kilograms and uh you know wh- whatever is whatever happens to be the thing that we're measuring it's in metric,1,0
sw3910B-ms98-a,36,B,131.918,145.565125,13.647125,well uh uh one one of the things that really i- i really think it would be sort of weird is is the uh cars the miles per hour instead of having uh having kilo- um kilometers per hour,1,0
sw3910B-ms98-a,47,B,217.948625,223.631375,5.68275,but uh of course if you didn't have anything available but metrics i think it'd be a little easier on you you know,1,0
sw3911A-ms98-a,39,A,186.961125,192.02325,5.062125,and they will be married nine years  this ,1,0

sw3913B-ms98-a,30,B,128.74,139.773625,11.033625,which was just a couple a hundred dollars to fix the one place and then he found out that the beam there was no support to attach his stuff to and it it turned out to be a mess ,1,0
sw3913B-ms98-a,45,B,248.684125,251.450875,2.76675,well that good it won't be too hot,1,0
sw3914A-ms98-a,7,A,90.094,96.11875,6.02475,well i guess i feel any of the automatic or semi automatic weapons should be,1,0
sw3914A-ms98-a,14,A,142.363875,153.512,11.148125,that's uh that's one i have a little bit of difficulty with knowing exactly which way but i do think that any of the the semi automatic weapons and all should be  not allowed at all,1,0
sw3914B-ms98-a,3,B,5.07525,15.145,10.06975,oh  i've i've gone back and forth on this subject uh many years my husband used to be uh when we were dating he used to really enjoy,1,0
sw3915A-ms98-a,37,A,140.696,153.91575,13.21975,but uh this one it just uh sort of has a well my husband enjoyed it i i just kind of m- you know mixed feelings i didn't know whether he w- it might be a woman's movie,1,0
sw3915B-ms98-a,43,B,178.086375,185.192,7.105625,i might go get it because_1 i i'm reading Newsweek right now and i'm going to be finished in a minute and and Bookstop stays open till eleven,1,0
sw3915B-ms98-a,49,B,210.720125,212.504875,1.78475,that could be difficult but uh,1,0
sw3916A-ms98-a,10,A,37.554875,38.89925,1.344375,you'd be,1,0
sw3916A-ms98-a,70,A,272.28025,285.892875,13.612625, a lot of what we are looking at are are skills that the person is gonna have to be able to perform to be able to live independently once they leave the hospital and we sometimes help the family make that decision if it looks like they're gonna be able to,3,0
sw3916B-ms98-a,4,B,16.14125,30.44825,14.307,i really look to the future that it may be  um i don't know what i'll do i i'm almost inclined to hire somebody um to be in our home with her rather than have to,2,0
sw3916B-ms98-a,8,B,46.427625,53.116875,6.68925,um you know the stigma used to be you went there and and you died and so they have all kind of,1,0
sw3916B-ms98-a,13,B,62.98825,71.155375,8.167125,you know i wouldn't want her in one in Florida because_1 i couldn't check on her but if she were in one near here i- i would probably be there,1,0
sw3916B-ms98-a,24,B,105.2695,116.01975,10.75025,eventually the hospital comes and says you know your father uh c- you know Medicare says he doesn't need the level of care to be hospitalized so you are going to,1,0
sw3916B-ms98-a,36,B,203.82575,216.24875,12.423,uh up to date however it was clean and the patients were well cared for and i like it because it had like a level of five to one and i felt that  that would be ,1,0
sw3917A-ms98-a,28,A,131.219375,137.49725,6.277875,thing will be you know is a good thing now they're moving them up and they're sharp and they,1,0
sw3917A-ms98-a,42,A,195.26525,205.120875,9.855625,you know you should be able to accomplish as much and i think the uh attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now,1,0
sw3918A-ms98-a,82,A,238.81825,241.61775,2.7995,go- that would be scary,1,0
sw3918A-ms98-a,83,A,241.61775,243.359625,1.741875,that would be really scary,1,0
sw3918A-ms98-a,87,A,257.576125,260.23425,2.658125,see i'm so excited i think that'll be fun,1,0
sw3918B-ms98-a,45,B,132.549875,134.49075,1.940875,well that'll be fun,1,0
sw3918B-ms98-a,46,B,134.49075,135.5075,1.01675,that'll be,1,0
sw3918B-ms98-a,64,B,191.015375,192.4995,1.484125,oh well that is going to be neat,1,0
sw3918B-ms98-a,72,B,219.122,224.809625,5.687625,he liked it uh yeah he liked it a lot he happened to be there during earthquakes and uh,1,0
sw3919A-ms98-a,4,A,16.0765,25.973875,9.897375,uh at the same time i i think they may still be a threat in a different sort of a way in that uh the situation over there is so unstable,1,0
sw3919A-ms98-a,20,A,101.138875,107.57025,6.431375,yeah but even so he seems to be a much more reasonable person than than you know previous Soviet leaders,1,0
sw3919B-ms98-a,79,B,276.863875,282.374625,5.51075,yeah i wish there was that kind of uh stuff over here  be great  ,1,0
sw3920A-ms98-a,15,A,64.328125,73.5095,9.181375,really be limited but like you say if they take uh if they have gun c- control then they take away uh the citizens right to protect themselves,1,0
sw3920A-ms98-a,18,A,84.28625,96.112625,11.826375,uh pheasants and things like that and uh they impose a gun control law that would really be disastrous i think bec- because_1 i think the criminals will get guns no matter what,1,0
sw3920A-ms98-a,30,A,150.374125,154.29375,3.919625,it  that would be terrible,1,0
sw3920B-ms98-a,5,B,19.334125,30.455875,11.12175,i feel that it may be necessary with the crime coming out this way that we'd be allowed to have the f- necessary facilities to protect ourselves,2,0
sw3921A-ms98-a,49,A,232.58575,234.41475,1.829,wouldn't that be something,1,0
sw3921B-ms98-a,35,B,136.886125,149.413375,12.52725,and you're right i i mean i like to fish for trout and they are really uh uh good fighters but uh if i went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu ,1,0
sw3922A-ms98-a,17,A,49.769375,61.850125,12.08075,and um it's pretty casual i mean it can be pretty casual it seems like um  well wi- our weather that we have here in Texas that um,1,0
sw3922A-ms98-a,40,A,180.190375,185.14475,4.954375,wh- what i've got going like if i've if i'm gonna be meeting with customers,1,0
sw3922A-ms98-a,41,A,185.14475,196.141875,10.997125,then uh you know get all {dolled} up      but you know what i mean um but if i'm just gonna be sitting at my desk all day then,1,0
sw3922A-ms98-a,49,A,238.3215,248.25475,9.93325,stuff you know and yeah so that'll be great to wear you know units pants with the sweaters so fortunately TI is flexible enough that,1,0
sw3922A-ms98-a,53,A,268.93475,275.8125,6.87775,so i do that even at work it's more it if i do wear jeans that might be the day that i wear them_1,1,0
sw3922B-ms98-a,2,B,0.045375,1.9995,1.954125,so we're supposed to be talking about,1,0
sw3922B-ms98-a,16,B,39.524375,44.569875,5.0455,anyway we're supposed to be discussing clothing right  um,1,0
sw3923A-ms98-a,74,A,265.602875,275.0935,9.490625,uh what's your opinion about those i'm my my home's gonna need to be either reshingled or reroofed in the near future we don't have a lot of heavy snow right here in Twin Falls,1,0
sw3923B-ms98-a,54,B,279.63575,287.096375,7.460625,uh i'd be real careful extreme temperature changes uh affect the metal roofs,1,0
sw3924B-ms98-a,21,B,79.436125,91.52075,12.084625,and uh whether those diseases can yo- some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research uh didn't uh,1,0
sw3924B-ms98-a,23,B,93.447375,101.29575,7.848375,i uh then part of it's lack of education i don't know whether whether you know where our money would be most effectively spent,1,0
sw3924B-ms98-a,31,B,140.40675,150.350125,9.943375,and i'm not certain i i again this i'm telling you basically i don't have any opinion but whether or not it would be uh our money would be better spent uh,2,0
sw3924B-ms98-a,51,B,260.330125,264.395125,4.065,i think maybe more information should be given out about it,1,0
sw3924B-ms98-a,56,B,286.343875,296.455125,10.11125,exactly and why can't you why can't the FDA say you know i- if these people knowingly consent to be research monkeys and well let them_1 let them_1 do it,1,0
sw3925A-ms98-a,15,A,67.56675,76.9655,9.39875,right and that would be a next question to ask how many do you think are in there for pub- for but because they wanna be of service to us,2,0
sw3925A-ms98-a,28,A,129.6805,132.944375,3.263875,to only be there to serve us you know,1,0
sw3925A-ms98-a,43,A,182.2645,185.470875,3.206375,and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at,1,0
sw3925A-ms98-a,47,A,196.020375,206.40775,10.387375,you know i also think it'd be funny if we could kn- know everything about the people that were in there and threw them_1 out i don't think there would be too many   ,2,0
sw3925B-ms98-a,9,B,63.804125,69.650375,5.84625,um-hum so they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers b-,1,0
sw3925B-ms98-a,13,B,84.604375,93.535125,8.93075,right yeah but i think maybe a lot of them um say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves it may be more a matter of ,1,0
sw3925B-ms98-a,15,B,102.125375,109.083625,6.95825,so i guess it would be like anything else the president of General Motors probably has the same ,1,0
sw3925B-ms98-a,19,B,132.423875,143.44975,11.025875,i think a little more honesty in campaigns would be more to the point if you knew what you were getting when you voted uh  yeah,1,0
sw3926A-ms98-a,19,A,120.067,133.301875,13.234875,um i really think that the the the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they're guilty or not but i also think that the jury should be,1,0
sw3926A-ms98-a,24,A,172.81725,180.936,8.11875,that would be certainly nice sh- let's say we we would have fifty percent of them_1 law students at any rate yeah yeah,1,0
sw3926A-ms98-a,28,A,186.35075,195.267625,8.916875,that's a very neat idea and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial,1,0
sw3926A-ms98-a,30,A,196.415,198.884,2.469,that would be a a really good thing to do,1,0
sw3926A-ms98-a,50,A,269.76025,276.036,6.27575,that is a shame you'd think there would be enough uh people who saw the accident other than his wife,1,0
sw3926B-ms98-a,6,B,17.860375,29.111875,11.2515,well as i look at our trial systems i think they've gotten to be quite a joke the way that people can appeal and file for mistrials and they've taken a lot of the things that that were set up to make it be a fair system,2,0
sw3926B-ms98-a,10,B,41.677625,48.2845,6.606875,i think the judge should hold the fi- or maybe even forty nine and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other,1,0
sw3926B-ms98-a,12,B,51.0715,56.7875,5.716,i think he should and i think that there should be more than one judge there should be maybe two,2,0
sw3926B-ms98-a,30,B,169.649875,173.871125,4.22125,and had that be credit hours to sit in trials,1,0
sw3926B-ms98-a,36,B,194.5025,197.736125,3.233625,that's right that would be a really good thing to do,1,0
sw3926B-ms98-a,47,B,246.776125,256.832375,10.05625,and they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials um this and that and the other every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of a of a settlement,1,0
sw3926B-ms98-a,49,B,262.44875,270.37625,7.9275,which i would think it would be some his fault but i just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money the big lawyers and she didn't,1,0
sw3926B-ms98-a,55,B,293.150125,298.39575,5.245625,and i don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say,1,0
sw3928A-ms98-a,23,A,123.329875,134.527125,11.19725,and uh he said one of his bosses was saying that you know should someone test positive that didn't necessarily mean that they would be fired and my friend said well they ought to fire him and he said well perhaps that's you know,1,0
sw3928A-ms98-a,24,A,134.527125,143.92,9.392875,this boss well maybe that might be a little harsh and he said no i'm not  about firing him for doing the drugs i'm talking about firing him because_1 he's so stupid that they would continue to do it -],1,0
sw3928A-ms98-a,33,A,193.59575,200.706125,7.110375,but uh perhaps the recreational use might be declining a little bit and i hope it is,1,0
sw3928B-ms98-a,10,B,62.426625,68.1735,5.746875,i definitely feel these people should be tested particularly in light of some of the accidents that have happened,1,0
sw3928B-ms98-a,28,B,200.178875,210.375625,10.19675,well it's just so frightening when i hear of of uh children in grade school you know that are being exposed to this i i would hate to be a child today and have the peer pressure,1,0
sw3928B-ms98-a,35,B,221.093125,227.099875,6.00675,well perhaps uh there will be a turnaround you know you hear the statistics and they do say that,1,0
sw3929A-ms98-a,6,A,25.64275,35.48425,9.8415,a musician i just took it kind of as an avocation and i sing with the Brookhaven singers over at Brookhaven College you must be familiar with that name living in Dallas,1,0
sw3929B-ms98-a,17,B,118.67825,131.212375,12.534125,i i haven't uh quite found jazz to be enjoyable and and and a lot of Gershwin has a a some of some of his work is a little uh ha- ha- has a tou- e- enough of jazz uh,1,0
sw3930A-ms98-a,16,A,48.35425,55.379875,7.025625,personally i think it would be a deterrent if uh they were able to carry this out without many appeals,1,0
sw3930A-ms98-a,21,A,76.941125,79.471875,2.53075,that they should be uh,1,0
sw3930A-ms98-a,23,A,85.67475,91.85225,6.1775,and if people it's just if they want to do it they do it and then they they think well i'll be out in uh,1,0
sw3930A-ms98-a,57,A,271.26025,284.222875,12.962625,uh about a month ago and uh of course he he said he wanted to be because he he had done the you know he he admitted to it and everything he said i just don't want to stay in prison and ,1,0
sw3930B-ms98-a,26,B,195.7975,206.741125,10.943625,yeah you know li- like you say you know anything they do they don't care they could go out and rob somebody if they get caught they know they're just going to be out in just a little while anyhow,1,0
sw3931A-ms98-a,63,A,123.185,125.979375,2.794375,um he's just getting ready to be six months,1,0
sw3931A-ms98-a,93,A,212.11175,221.9195,9.80775,and i love our  i think the cat's great i wish we i wish i could get a cat for to be with this dog to get some energy out so he can play with the cat ,1,0
sw3931B-ms98-a,42,B,103.63325,107.84275,4.2095,and she's going to be thirteen years old here  in April,1,0
sw3931B-ms98-a,45,B,113.723875,120.164,6.440125,hopefully she'll be around for a while she's become quite the part of the family ,1,0
sw3932B-ms98-a,2,B,0.354125,3.84675,3.492625,it's going to be a hard one huh why,1,0
sw3932B-ms98-a,33,B,122.303875,131.18525,8.881375,i- you know each family has their own own way of doing it i- i do it about the same way you do you know we pay what what needs to be paid,1,0
sw3933A-ms98-a,13,A,50.646875,58.193625,7.54675,that might be more motivating um in relation to what you just mentioned if it were somehow of interest to them,1,0
sw3933A-ms98-a,24,A,105.718125,112.386625,6.6685,go through in terms of their day to day existence if you're working in Peace Corps for example you're really gonna be able to learn those things,1,0
sw3933A-ms98-a,41,A,174.230125,179.54875,5.318625,it's one thing because they recognize there's a minimal danger where where they might be but if you're ,1,0
sw3933A-ms98-a,55,A,251.032125,260.38275,9.350625,that they require that you do X number of volunteer hours i think it's a hundred or so before you can even be accepted into the school program to become a therapist,1,0
sw3933A-ms98-a,59,A,280.65525,292.2825,11.62725,it is to be an OT or a PT and having been a volunteer they'll certainly see people on the job and recognize well this is really what i wanna do i wanna spend three or four years getting this ,1,0
sw3933B-ms98-a,5,B,25.811875,34.944125,9.13225,maybe quality time effort energy from somebody who really truly wants to be there so although i believe in it i'm not sure requiring it would be the way to go,2,0
sw3933B-ms98-a,25,B,195.66925,206.901125,11.231875,switchboard suggested Peace Corps i kind of like you i thought international or going out of the country and i i look around though and there's an awful lot of public service that could be done within our own communities and our own,1,0
sw3933B-ms98-a,26,B,206.901125,217.687375,10.78625,you know a lot of times people say i don't wanna go somewhere else i wanna help my own community you know U- United Way i want my dollars to work here something like that so that might also be a motivating factor then,1,0
sw3935A-ms98-a,6,A,30.910875,39.50875,8.597875,i guess i've just begun to take that for advantage that buttons are not gonna be sewn on i mean took that for uh granted that buttons are not gonna be sewn on very well,2,0
sw3936A-ms98-a,49,A,233.542,244.648,11.106,and i uh sure hope we we really need the moisture i hope we can get uh get some there's supposed to be a storm but it split went down through uh northern Arizona and southern Utah and ,1,0

sw3937A-ms98-a,49,A,180.9095,188.453875,7.544375,we'd be able to save a lot of trees and everything else so i've been i i i'm all for it i just don't know uh,1,0
sw3937A-ms98-a,75,A,288.12125,293.423875,5.302625,uh there they seem to be having success and but it is a uh,1,0
sw3937B-ms98-a,14,B,76.6325,91.499625,14.867125,well i noticed a difference uh we go to the Kroger store uh here to take our aluminum cans and i noticed a difference you know i'd be getting perhaps a dollar for whatever i took in and i think the last bunch i took in which i didn't think was much smaller was maybe twenty six cents,1,0
sw3937B-ms98-a,19,B,152.0945,166.476125,14.381625,pay the price you know whether the government subsidizes it and i'm you know i sorry to the gov- government get involved in too much of anything else like that but something has to be done we're just uh we're using our natural resources we're filling up the dumps and,1,0
sw3937B-ms98-a,27,B,231.00225,242.8995,11.89725,and um i'm hoping that they do this curbside recycling i'll be willing to pay a little extra you know if they'll go ahead and pick it up quite frankly it'll save me money in gas running around   ,1,0
sw3938A-ms98-a,32,A,205.09025,216.170375,11.080125,is true for one person may not necessarily be true for another because other you know so many different people have different needs and and and desires as uh as far as cars are concerned but uh,1,0
sw3938A-ms98-a,41,A,283.06675,291.993,8.92625,so it's it you know i i think it depends i i i guess there's certain instances that that could be the best thing to do but i don't think i'll go that route again,1,0
sw3938B-ms98-a,14,B,68.879375,76.84875,7.969375,you can't fall in love with one you've got to be able to turn your back on and the- by the time everyone had given me their advice i thought you know this car turns on every morning,1,0
sw3938B-ms98-a,21,B,99.050125,107.915,8.864875,and i wanted an air bag i thought that would really be a nice thing to have Volvos are safe cars the other thing is i drive all parts of town,1,0
sw3938B-ms98-a,44,B,223.837,234.557125,10.720125,uh-huh  and yeah well th- that's my feeling too and eventually they'll be coming out with cars that you know have much better gas mileage or use different kind of gas which is something that matters to me,1,0
sw3939A-ms98-a,3,A,2.946375,11.68325,8.736875,well i i like uh i guess it would be easier to say tell you what kind i don't like i don't like hard rock,1,0

sw3939B-ms98-a,44,B,149.13775,157.877,8.73925,well that that i like and i used to live in Mexico so i like i like Mexican music to a certain extent just be- because it reminds me of that time,1,0
sw3940A-ms98-a,31,A,179.370375,190.83625,11.465875,uh give any information on how to compete they do say that if you're going to be in the Los Angeles area and want free tickets they tell you how to get that but they don't ever say anything about uh uh,1,0
sw3940A-ms98-a,32,A,190.83625,194.942875,4.106625,uh uh com- you know how to how to get to be a c- a competitor,1,0
sw3940A-ms98-a,34,A,197.012,205.97,8.958,well they might they might that could be it and then again it could just be that they want people to take the initiative to write in you know expressing an interest i don't know,2,0
sw3942A-ms98-a,12,A,33.002375,39.693875,6.6915,uh uh can all unethical behavior or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal,1,0
sw3942A-ms98-a,16,A,74.070125,88.936125,14.866,it becomes more evident perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or you know etcetera like that  and we,1,0
sw3942A-ms98-a,19,A,109.843625,118.942625,9.099,should it be our  uh prerogative to see into the private lives of these people you know um,1,0
sw3942A-ms98-a,27,A,134.96,148.488,13.528,i- i- i agree with that and  um and also that if the  results that they are putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's,1,0
sw3942A-ms98-a,42,A,265.647375,277.65475,12.007375,whatever um although i admire the people that do that and they certainly do get inside information and um of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing ,1,0
sw3942A-ms98-a,44,A,286.09275,298.562,12.46925, kind of be aware and then uh i don't like to make a whole lot of um judgment m- myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that uh,1,0
sw3942B-ms98-a,24,B,129.08775,136.025,6.93725,sometimes i don't know i- i think it gets in the way of the better judgement i mean just because he did something in his past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician,1,0
sw3943A-ms98-a,54,A,224.48275,233.589625,9.106875,so when i- i don't LBJ's a perfect example of how somebody can be broke and get into politics and come out rich as yeah,1,0
sw3943A-ms98-a,58,A,239.555125,253.426625,13.8715, well th- they used to say in advertising that the textbook example of good competitive adver- advertising is Hertz and Avis rent a car commercials number one number two i guess LBJ has to be a textbook example of politician without any morals,1,0
sw3943B-ms98-a,6,B,27.602125,40.093875,12.49175,yeah that's supposed to be great i don't know as long as there lawyers making up the majority of the state legislatures and the national Congress uh,1,0
sw3943B-ms98-a,9,B,61.457625,69.449625,7.992,isn't that funny how that just happens to be a correlation ,1,0
sw3943B-ms98-a,22,B,153.47925,166.215125,12.735875,just just say that the most you can serve is a couple of terms and then get in there and then you could get in there and do the best possible job that you really feel like you should be doing and then you're out of there and go on to something else instead of this,1,0
sw3943B-ms98-a,44,B,265.743625,274.247875,8.50425,well that's it when the very people making the laws are gonna be the ones who would have to pass those uh against themselves it it sort of uh,1,0
sw3943B-ms98-a,45,B,274.247875,284.68175,10.433875,goes without saying that it'd be awfully awfully tough unless you could get the best thing that could happen uh to the state legislatures would be to be full of just,3,0
sw3944A-ms98-a,31,A,170.32725,173.327875,3.000625,it might not be because_1 it's been a while,1,0
sw3945B-ms98-a,4,B,9.187125,19.550375,10.36325,that's hard to say you know i think it take a lot for granted you know and it's th- the quick answer i think would be that you pay too much taxes you know but but i think if you think about it,1,0
sw3945B-ms98-a,35,B,213.847375,227.762875,13.9155,you know when the pr- uh one good thing that could be said for the profit motive is people aren't going to run a business at a loss i happen to work for a city for the City of New York and uh that's the attitude that uh at least my agency takes,1,0
sw3945B-ms98-a,37,B,231.9795,245.908125,13.928625,and and if you're not going to run it profitably then you're going to be out of business because they are going to privatize it so in that sense you know at my agency a- and it's unique i think for government agencies is revenue producing,1,0
sw3945B-ms98-a,44,B,291.461875,299.298,7.836125,uh you know we are buying protection you know we are protecting ourselves from from uh from other countries that we may be afraid of whether it's right,1,0
sw3946A-ms98-a,6,A,29.902,35.189875,5.287875,i think they would be better off being at home with their family,1,0
sw3946A-ms98-a,16,A,61.67075,73.486625,11.815875,oh i can believe that yes because most elderly people can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that in a situation like that maybe it would be better,1,0
sw3946A-ms98-a,34,A,121.04725,130.599375,9.552125,yeah in a case like that you know you more or less think it it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where,1,0
sw3946A-ms98-a,50,A,184.153875,195.62725,11.473375,yeah you know just come home for dinner and then usually they want to go to bed pretty early anyhow you know so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that but,1,0
sw3946A-ms98-a,65,A,231.442125,239.68775,8.245625,if if they don't know anybody and they don't know what's going on around them and everything like that well i can see maybe a nursing home would be better you know,1,0
sw3946A-ms98-a,72,A,259.391375,265.339,5.947625,well uh my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that and,1,0
sw3946B-ms98-a,11,B,94.916125,103.604,8.687875,and her trying to struggle because her mother really cannot take care of herself she needs to be bathed and dressed and a lot of those kinds of things,1,0
sw3946B-ms98-a,14,B,109.113875,118.296875,9.183,and when the kids have kids come over you know she's always saying well why do they have to be here why can't they send them home it's too noisy and she'll say that to the kid's friends,1,0
sw3946B-ms98-a,26,B,175.582125,185.09325,9.511125,and she could be around some elderly people and have some activities would be of more interest to her and then in the evening have her return and be with the family,3,0
sw3946B-ms98-a,37,B,246.258875,258.149,11.890125,and then i think it depends on their physical ability too you know if they could be up and doing some things it might be better than when they're just sort of needing almost constant supervision and care,2,0
sw3947A-ms98-a,13,A,34.702625,39.17175,4.469125,yeah that's too bad i'm i guess i'd be most familiar with uh the Jazz,1,0
sw3947B-ms98-a,19,B,81.414625,84.637125,3.2225,well he must he must be a pretty big guy,1,0
sw3947B-ms98-a,23,B,100.217875,108.184125,7.96625,well it's it's it's nice to see tho- th- you know those kind of guys when they get paid all those big bucks to uh you know to be halfway friendly,1,0
sw3947B-ms98-a,52,B,243.54925,253.039625,9.490375,yeah once once uh he starts losing that weight and can't keep it on you know he'll have to slow down and not not do that kind of stuff that that's got to be awful tou- awful tough on his bod-,1,0
sw3948A-ms98-a,36,A,191.28575,196.84975,5.564,blue jeans   always seem to be pretty rugged and pretty tough and,1,0
sw3948B-ms98-a,34,B,174.532125,178.000875,3.46875,worse quality now than they used to be or,1,0
sw3948B-ms98-a,42,B,196.15525,201.976625,5.821375,see- seem to  not just sort of be unchanging yeah yeah,1,0
sw3949A-ms98-a,64,A,211.013,218.5025,7.4895,th- there has to be a balance there's got to be both there but i think it should be a little stronger on the academic uh portion,3,0
sw3949B-ms98-a,2,B,42.1995,48.284375,6.084875,oh i'd say uh we probably have what cou- could be described as  problems,1,0
sw3949B-ms98-a,33,B,199.663,206.52425,6.86125,i think learning social interaction is good too but uh i think it has to be a balanced curriculum,1,0
sw3949B-ms98-a,38,B,235.174,237.679375,2.505375,coming up to where they should be,1,0

sw3951B-ms98-a,20,B,53.743125,61.623,7.879875,yeah just about ev- i've never had one but everybody i know who has they don't have too many complaints which is can't be said about a lot of cars,1,0
sw3951B-ms98-a,24,B,73.595125,81.92275,8.327625,it'd be good i look was i looked at a Toyota 4-Runner actually it's the same type of deal but smaller kind of like the S-10s,1,0
sw3952A-ms98-a,6,A,36.5965,42.86975,6.27325,and she can be upstairs in the bedroom and i don't know she knows what i'm talking about you know pretty soon here she comes,1,0
sw3952A-ms98-a,11,A,69.77225,75.88875,6.1165,you know i can tell when i do it and when i don't do it you know so you know it's got to be good for you,1,0
sw3952A-ms98-a,23,A,121.478625,127.274,5.795375,yeah otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far huh ,1,0

sw3954B-ms98-a,22,B,116.7265,131.16975,14.44325,uh is the real time you really want to put into them_1 for the training as far as the initial training and he said if you give them_1 just that much then the rest of their life with you is just going to be real nice and and,1,0
sw3954B-ms98-a,32,B,196.408125,208.50075,12.092625,yeah  yeah just started doing it with little pieces of cheese and boy  the dogs really even at the age of ten i would just still be teaching them_1 new tricks just as long as you give them_1 something to,1,0

sw3955A-ms98-a,36,A,190.454875,200.357125,9.90225,but they they specify that or just tell them_1 that they'll have to kind of be careful well and it's the same with alcoholic beverages they they test for that too,1,0
sw3955A-ms98-a,38,A,204.342375,213.111875,8.7695,but in the work place i i feel that it it should be uh something that the employers have the right to do if they want,1,0
sw3955B-ms98-a,62,B,264.349375,271.23,6.880625,but i certainly wouldn't be opposed um i- is it hard for you to tell people that are on drugs i mean,1,0

sw3979A-ms98-a,28,A,242.1305,254.192625,12.062125, well i would think that uh information held on records uh by any company or charge card dealer or or person should be absolutely p- private and,1,0
sw3979A-ms98-a,29,A,254.192625,259.106,4.913375,and not be allowed to be uh to given out by those companies,2,0
sw3979A-ms98-a,30,A,259.106,271.0375,11.9315,i mean it it should be made a a uh national or a state law to protect people so that uh you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies,1,0
sw3979A-ms98-a,31,A,271.0375,283.57025,12.53275,in other words if you call the company yourself directly uh and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else uh you know from the outside so to speak then you'd,2,0
sw3979A-ms98-a,33,A,287.845125,300.066,12.220875,but but we have no control of that now and then uh you you're when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you you feel that it someday might be used against you,1,0
sw3979B-ms98-a,27,B,142.277875,149.8305,7.552625,twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company,1,0
sw3979B-ms98-a,45,B,233.952625,238.861625,4.909,what can be done to ensure that they don't um,1,0
sw3980A-ms98-a,13,A,48.60925,59.55325,10.944,because_1 i was waiting to get someone that would say yeah well you know it's hard to spend time with my kids and i was just gonna be like gritting my teeth  hoping not to say something i didn't mean to,1,0
sw3980A-ms98-a,40,A,131.579125,141.348125,9.769,see i see too i mean i it sounds bad and i know people would totally disagree and say it shouldn't have to be a choice but for the welfare of the kid i think it is ,1,0
sw3980B-ms98-a,36,B,171.931625,181.632,9.700375,that if you and you'd make i know that when they're all going all different directions but i used to at least make three mea- three meals out of a week they had to be together,1,0
sw3980B-ms98-a,55,B,285.469,299.138,13.669,yeah and make that day for shopping or going out to lunch or just taking them_1 to the park alone and you'd be surprised what they'll talk about when you're just sitting there on a swing talking,1,0
sw3982B-ms98-a,10,B,69.95525,77.880875,7.925625,i- i think so i think so and and i you couldn't pay me enough to be a teacher in a bad in a bad city,1,0
sw3983B-ms98-a,28,B,186.03775,199.1705,13.13275, i'm not sure that um in the case of National Geographic i mean i read it but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time but then eventually there'll be a school project or something,1,0
sw3983B-ms98-a,38,B,256.01775,264.982375,8.964625, he does but  does get to be a lot of paper though after a while  if you don't keep them_1 weeded out they almost take over ,1,0
sw3984A-ms98-a,23,A,47.840125,54.759,6.918875,but i think if i was going to go to work and stuff i think a dress or more like a suit would would be more appropriate for sure,1,0
sw3984A-ms98-a,34,A,84.737125,89.0035,4.266375,i haven't had to wear that many dress clothes yet to be honest you know,1,0
sw3984A-ms98-a,43,A,131.36925,135.663125,4.293875,yeah well that would be important though i mean you would have to,1,0
sw3984A-ms98-a,73,A,268.543375,274.522125,5.97875,yeah i probably will go to graduate school because_1 i want to be a marriage counselor,1,0
sw3985A-ms98-a,44,A,244.92175,254.61275,9.691,yes but it it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job but it might be whether the lo- locality there those people want that kind of support,2,0
sw3985B-ms98-a,26,B,152.373625,158.052375,5.67875,um that it take care of them_1 they don't none of them_1 really want to be rich but they like to have enough to be comfortable,2,0
sw3985B-ms98-a,34,B,199.945125,206.562,6.616875,no not necessarily um it can be in house people who help you handle X amount of dollars,1,0
sw3985B-ms98-a,47,B,279.28425,284.657875,5.373625,see we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it i don't think anybo- any i think most people want to be,1,0
sw3985B-ms98-a,48,B,284.657875,295.148125,10.49025,lack a better termi- terminology they want to be self employed but they don't want to take the risk in other words they like to control their own future but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please,2,0
sw3986B-ms98-a,30,B,106.583875,115.55475,8.970875,i uh i really believe they're getting better and you know i- i- i looked around and seen some of those new Saturns and stuff and they seem to be a really nice car,1,0
sw3987A-ms98-a,61,A,201.43125,210.6475,9.21625,but she says my little bit of savings will probably pay for a nursing home for maybe a year and then i'll be on Medicaid anyway so she said,1,0
sw3987B-ms98-a,28,B,133.00225,145.884375,12.882125,it woul- i- what would be real nice is find one around the corner that you could visit that you could go in and uh talk to the people talk to some of the people's uh uh siblings,1,0
sw3987B-ms98-a,32,B,180.6055,186.708625,6.103125,and course there's a lot to be said about uh making a member destitute,1,0
sw3987B-ms98-a,39,B,224.006625,231.743125,7.7365,well yeah and that's true because uh after the year's gone all of her savings are going to be eaten up and if she owns her house uh,1,0
sw3987B-ms98-a,48,B,274.400625,283.58925,9.188625,see that should be provided for before she ever goes out of her monies or otherwise you know the the uh the uh the kids have to provide that,1,0

sw4007A-ms98-a,36,A,126.33275,137.53475,11.202,i like you're feeling the frustration of what they're picking up on that's exactly the worries that i had is that i worried about what kind of things they might be exposed to or pick up on and i was just really,1,0
sw4007A-ms98-a,37,A,137.53475,147.102875,9.568125,paranoid and i guess just decided to be my own child's caregiver and at times i've regretted it just because_1 i miss working with adults and uh ,1,0

sw4010A-ms98-a,17,A,68.06575,82.790375,14.724625,that can also be affected by that and i think what they have to do in the interest of fairness or to keep from getting sued or something is test everybody in the company at least on a random basis in other words no matter whether you work in uh defense or,1,0
sw4010A-ms98-a,25,A,127.10575,134.15575,7.05,or in our case be forced to go to all this counseling and that sort of stuff you know just in the case of a false positive,1,0
sw4010A-ms98-a,29,A,143.280625,148.17725,4.896625,yes they can and i think that's probably be more acceptable i believe it's more accurate,1,0
sw4010A-ms98-a,39,A,189.551875,196.3835,6.831625,it's just you know the whole idea of all the hassles you'd have to go through and certainly the records that would be left behind,1,0
sw4010A-ms98-a,50,A,231.497375,235.3715,3.874125,or uh what seems to be more of a problem train drivers,1,0
sw4010B-ms98-a,51,B,174.791875,180.608875,5.817,i mean i- i- i would just think there was a way there'd be a way around it if i mean even if you did test positive you could probably get tested again,1,0
sw4011A-ms98-a,15,A,65.64375,74.50875,8.865,i see um do you think that uh putting putting those people in jail permanently would be an equally good solution,1,0
sw4011A-ms98-a,22,A,104.132875,118.52575,14.392875,well certainly for for someone like Charles Manson who's very definitely going to stay in jail for the rest of his life i uh i- i can't imagine that he will ever be allowed out by the parole board that uh his life is not going to improve,1,0
sw4011A-ms98-a,28,A,162.82725,174.677,11.84975,um well  to be honest i think that the uh capital punishment is is is a uh red herring in the crime and punishment business ,1,0

sw4011A-ms98-a,42,A,265.0705,278.4315,13.361,and uh that's you know for them the death penalty is irrelevant i mean it's what what difference is that going to make to them there's got to be more effective policing and there's got to be more trust on both sides of the equation,2,0
sw4011B-ms98-a,13,B,52.63175,57.92575,5.294,concur that there are some people that have to be kept away,1,0
sw4011B-ms98-a,14,B,57.92575,66.397375,8.471625,forever yeah i mean i really do think there are some people that there's nothing that can be done about so it makes a dilemma for me,1,0
sw4011B-ms98-a,16,B,74.337,82.722875,8.385875,i- i the i always think about it in terms of myself and i really wonder if i'd really wanna be in jail for the rest of my life or just killed,1,0
sw4011B-ms98-a,17,B,82.722875,86.49325,3.770375,i mean i think i and some have asked to be killed,1,0
sw4011B-ms98-a,35,B,232.682625,240.8065,8.123875,right and may be killed on the street anyway death is not that   i mean   or the other death is part of their everyday lives,1,0

sw4012A-ms98-a,35,A,128.47525,138.620125,10.144875,no remorse or anything you know i feel like that's the right thing to do and i guess i would have to say it would be for more circumstances you know,1,0
sw4012A-ms98-a,67,A,252.003375,256.996375,4.993,yeah it'd be easier if at least if someone was,1,0
sw4012A-ms98-a,68,A,256.996375,266.08425,9.087875,you know sentenced to death then if they were to have to have an appeal it should be taken care of as quickly as possible you know,1,0
sw4012A-ms98-a,71,A,273.371,279.030375,5.659375,God there's something so it'd be done faster you know because_1 then they complain about the jails and the,1,0
sw4012B-ms98-a,14,B,23.126875,33.423125,10.29625,a necessary tool that uh needs to be used uh to establish justice in some cases and to that that it if used properly,1,0

sw4017A-ms98-a,3,A,14.329,21.685875,7.356875,to help the budget the first i believe in would be to give the president a line item veto um,1,0
sw4017A-ms98-a,7,A,40.459,50.34175,9.88275,to make the tough decisions and sometimes it would be best to give that over to the president who who has overall responsibility for the whole country and can uh,1,0
sw4017A-ms98-a,8,A,50.34175,57.507625,7.165875,i guess be a little bit more insulated from from uh the concerns of one of one district,1,0

sw4017A-ms98-a,41,A,291.581,298.306,6.725,yeah another area that's that i really think ought to be cut is is direct uh foreign aid,1,0
sw4017B-ms98-a,7,B,67.3265,77.918125,10.591625,uh have the opportunity to slide things in that normally should not have gone in at all and the l- yeah and the line item uh veto would be ideal for that i mean to,1,0
sw4017B-ms98-a,20,B,152.63525,161.295375,8.660125,or if contracts are put out uh no one uh is responsible or it does does not seem to be,1,0

sw4028A-ms98-a,18,A,74.498875,84.018625,9.51975,that's in my opinion that's gett- that's bordering on a health clinic but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage um,1,0
sw4028B-ms98-a,19,B,94.433625,102.996,8.562375,i- i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh they usually sign a contract or something and um,1,0

sw4034A-ms98-a,51,A,200.02775,208.505875,8.478125,i'm i don't not sure if anybody really sent donations in to this private company just to be nice and i believe they're going to start charging now,1,0
sw4034A-ms98-a,56,A,219.388,221.98575,2.59775,okay for us to be charged for it,1,0
sw4035A-ms98-a,53,A,209.606875,222.874625,13.26775,you know that that that that you know that that you are going to be stuck is going to be stuck with life imprisonment you know or two hundred and fifty years you know none of it served you know at the same time that you know to give them the choice of having the death penalty ,2,0
sw4035A-ms98-a,64,A,273.555625,276.416,2.860375,and that always that always seemed to be you know some sort of ,1,0

sw4035B-ms98-a,37,B,249.653375,258.09225,8.438875,yeah i- i- i personally think people have the right to die if they want so yeah if you if you're in dea- if you're in jail for life then you should be able to commit suicide if that's what you want ,1,0
sw4036A-ms98-a,3,A,3.33325,12.77075,9.4375,of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted um,1,0
sw4036A-ms98-a,7,A,28.72075,32.78625,4.0655,uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted,1,0
sw4036A-ms98-a,57,A,206.565875,216.249375,9.6835,whether especially sort of in uh maybe like pro- product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes ,1,0

sw4037A-ms98-a,23,A,94.000875,102.77675,8.775875,a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder,1,0
sw4037A-ms98-a,30,A,130.565625,137.441875,6.87625,big time drug importers like uh say Noriega for example th- these people need to be uh eliminated uh,1,0
sw4037A-ms98-a,50,A,188.22875,197.21225,8.9835,do you uh are there cases where you think that that uh the capital  capital punishment shouldn't be uh uh sentenced ,1,0
sw4037B-ms98-a,30,B,151.9235,157.227125,5.303625,i ju- basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just,1,0
sw4037B-ms98-a,31,B,157.227125,166.3935,9.166375,y- you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated,2,0
sw4037B-ms98-a,33,B,175.36,184.811375,9.451375,to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so i i'm all in favor of it,2,0
sw4037B-ms98-a,35,B,196.807125,210.829,14.021875,well i- i really don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the Jeffrey Dahlmer case i mean i- i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets,1,0
sw4037B-ms98-a,36,B,210.829,216.06625,5.23725,and in that case Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment,1,0
sw4037B-ms98-a,37,B,216.06625,228.006375,11.940125,and i think that that he should not be allowed to live but you know then you're kind of playing God  which is n- never a good thing to do but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld,2,0
sw4037B-ms98-a,38,B,228.006375,238.503625,10.49725,uh not really that i can think of i i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers,1,0
sw4038A-ms98-a,27,A,107.131125,113.762125,6.631,uh-huh i see because you'd probably be uh too puritanical and to ,1,0
sw4038A-ms98-a,30,A,120.44075,130.49625,10.0555,so uh were were the uh sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair or would if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different,1,0
sw4038A-ms98-a,48,A,231.476375,245.6995,14.223125,i know on a getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous it's s- a simple majority you know rules,2,0
sw4038B-ms98-a,13,B,56.005625,65.149625,9.144,it was always we was exciting when we got called to to to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides uh just sit in the jury room,1,0
sw4038B-ms98-a,16,B,78.94675,85.40825,6.4615,i'd be questioned uh for impaneling the jury and they kept uh dismissing me,1,0
sw4038B-ms98-a,30,B,164.63575,175.970375,11.334625,allowed us to reach a verdict so i told the judge that uh we weren't were una- unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate so the whole thing had to be tried over again,1,0
sw4038B-ms98-a,47,B,246.44175,252.034875,5.593125,well let's see is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous and,1,0
sw4039A-ms98-a,10,A,61.247375,73.135375,11.888,and that's i- i don't have a budget other than that i know i need to and i know we probably will in the future but as of yet we're just still trying to you know get on on where we wanna be financially and then,1,0
sw4039A-ms98-a,19,A,107.335125,111.78025,4.445125,yeah yeah but i'm gonna be out of a job in September,1,0
sw4039A-ms98-a,23,A,122.447125,130.91025,8.463125,so i'll be staying down here  but i'm not real worried about it so but it's something else that you know we have to be considering in our budget,2,0
sw4039A-ms98-a,40,A,193.189375,204.705875,11.5165,he's kind of like a loan servicer accountant right now but he's trying to trying to switch over into international trade because you know with the free trade agreements going on here there's really gonna be a lot of opportunity,1,0
sw4040A-ms98-a,41,A,215.986625,221.925125,5.9385,it's not going to be very good i think they should talk about putting one right on the campus itself,1,0
sw4040B-ms98-a,32,B,96.454875,108.003875,11.549,so um  let's see i mean i- i was uh rea- i read a lot of articles on child care back when it was when there was a debate in Congress over funding of uh child care centers and what should be done,1,0
sw4040B-ms98-a,33,B,108.003875,120.571125,12.56725,and i came out uh very much in favor of a tax credit approach where parents would be given a tax credit and they would select whatever services they wanted for their child rather than to have the government subsidize certain providers,1,0
sw4040B-ms98-a,40,B,161.126,173.164125,12.038125,um so uh anyway  i continue to be an advocate of the um of the tax credit approach now myself i'm not married so i don't have any kids and it's not a problem but uh ,1,0
sw4040B-ms98-a,42,B,180.49675,194.59425,14.0975,gee i'm on the benefits committee at the university here and uh child care is a topic of conversation we the university started up a center this year but it's about two miles away from campus and i'm not sure it's going to be real convenient for people to take their kids over there,1,0
sw4040B-ms98-a,53,B,221.171125,227.578125,6.407,yeah well they say they claim that it's a better environment for kids than to be in with all the students ,1,0
sw4041A-ms98-a,23,A,112.5405,122.20975,9.66925,you know that's really hard and i don't know what you know what the different things that you would look for i mean obviously uh you want it to be cl- you know,1,0
sw4041A-ms98-a,36,A,176.37675,183.187625,6.810875,it doesn't feel i would think that would be easier than someone who really does know and is saying i d-,1,0
sw4041A-ms98-a,56,A,296.331875,299.074,2.742125,so then y- i guess you'd have to be there to be sure that that's,2,0
sw4041B-ms98-a,4,B,16.532625,22.996,6.463375,first just even deciding to do it and then i think feeling guilty after you know that it needs to be done you know,1,0
sw4041B-ms98-a,11,B,51.93725,56.047,4.10975,then too if you work you know you get there has to be somebody there,1,0
sw4041B-ms98-a,22,B,121.152125,123.58525,2.433125,it would be clean yeah,1,0
sw4041B-ms98-a,24,B,129.687375,140.266875,10.5795,i know and to make sure that there's enough people there to keep everybody like that can you know to be involved instead of just leaving them sit in their rooms you know,1,0
sw4041B-ms98-a,49,B,236.023,244.865125,8.842125,well that yeah would definitely be a positive part because_1 they'd be around more people and would be easier for them to get out and to see those people i guess,3,0
sw4041B-ms98-a,51,B,254.462875,260.997625,6.53475,well i would think that you ought to be in fact i was going to say that i would go at different times of the day not only when they're expecting you to come,1,0
sw4042A-ms98-a,18,A,74.564,80.72775,6.16375,right so economically it's not a situation where you're going be able to attract a lot of attention  ,1,0
sw4042A-ms98-a,25,A,119.49675,126.251625,6.754875,so it uh  there's not a lot of money to be made but it's just a question of trying to help the environment,1,0
sw4042B-ms98-a,23,B,93.28125,97.830625,4.549375,i would really be disturbed if i found out that the place i took it to,1,0
sw4043B-ms98-a,48,B,168.659125,172.747,4.087875,yeah well may- hey that may be more quality you know after all,1,0
sw4043B-ms98-a,70,B,253.383125,258.2105,4.827375,it'll probably be a while before i uh before i get into the kids' music in at all so,1,0
sw4044A-ms98-a,12,A,85.7,96.18675,10.48675,seems to be concerned with just that you know who's who's gonna start getting more and how fast um i kind of came of age in the,1,0
sw4044A-ms98-a,19,A,122.509,133.18775,10.67875,yeah i i've never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that the typical middle class family,1,0
sw4044A-ms98-a,23,A,155.45025,161.346375,5.896125,there seems to be a sort of a jealous guarding of resources by each generation ,1,0
sw4045A-ms98-a,13,A,58.9655,69.062375,10.096875,and um  the one nice thing though is i'm is i'm luck- is i'm pretty close to downtown so um  aluminum cans can be recycled just by tossing them out in your yard and the bums come around and ,1,0
sw4045A-ms98-a,33,A,115.8215,123.580875,7.759375,yeah yeah that seems like it would be you know very labor intensive to actually you know go through it all and pick out the different things,1,0
sw4045A-ms98-a,48,A,188.2845,199.708,11.4235, their you know the the the the the systems basically has this very large backlog of of material to be recycled and and processed and apparently in a lot you know in a lot of industries,1,0
sw4045B-ms98-a,20,B,101.614875,113.149,11.534125,yeah well i mean well y- yeah but i mean if you put you know i oh i see what you mean everything would be in the same bag and they would have to separate the cans from all the rest of the trash yeah,1,0
sw4045B-ms98-a,21,B,113.149,116.61425,3.46525,yeah that would that would be good because_1 uh you know,1,0
sw4045B-ms98-a,26,B,140.115625,150.2715,10.155875,um hm i suppose yeah but that would be cheaper than getting new plastic i- i think it's just the fact it raises the price temporarily that they don't like,1,0
sw4045B-ms98-a,27,B,150.2715,158.09125,7.81975,it should be anyway well did you see there was an interesting article about recycling in the Wall Street Journal about three or four weeks ago,1,0
sw4045B-ms98-a,39,B,228.94325,237.420625,8.477375, i would expect they ought to be more sensitive than they are or something i think that's one of the things people think of cutting back on but it certainly would be a way to save money  um,2,0
sw4045B-ms98-a,42,B,253.487,266.419375,12.932375,and i think some of the plastics are are are are among those that's rather difficult to re- it's just to recycle them there needs to be a greater economies of scale before they become uh viable,1,0
sw4045B-ms98-a,50,B,291.967,297.73,5.763, if i could get rid of that  it wouldn't be much at all it's just that,1,0
sw4046A-ms98-a,11,A,22.718625,26.7125,3.993875,seventy and my mother must be about sixty five,1,0
sw4046A-ms98-a,23,A,81.6655,88.042875,6.377375,you know certain health conditions that we wouldn't be able to handle and i think we've just sort of avoided thinking about it real hard,1,0
sw4046A-ms98-a,25,A,96.649625,102.90625,6.256625,that might be a good alternative i mean it is my impressions tens of thousands of dollars,1,0
sw4046A-ms98-a,44,A,170.7585,174.0145,3.256,well that's could be worse i think,1,0
sw4046A-ms98-a,47,A,179.021,182.405,3.384,yeah i- i think that might be s- might be sufficient ,2,0
sw4046B-ms98-a,17,B,61.25425,64.1895,2.93525,so it tends to be kind of useless anyway,1,0
sw4046B-ms98-a,54,B,161.353875,171.598125,10.24425,yeah i sure do they're they're pretty healthy everybody in my family seems to die when they're they're in good health but they get to be like seventy or eighty and all have aneurisms just drop dead,1,0
sw4046B-ms98-a,58,B,178.355875,179.912875,1.557,i'd be happy,1,0
sw4046B-ms98-a,61,B,192.904625,199.851125,6.9465,heart attacks that sort of thing and then you know they can't really help themselves so they have to be cared for,1,0
sw4046B-ms98-a,65,B,207.898375,215.025375,7.127,yeah i mean it seems like they'd be almost just you know better off just withholding care to some some degree ,1,0
sw4046B-ms98-a,87,B,264.010625,275.95425,11.943625,seems like uh unfortunately that many of those people who are put through those if they'd uh let their wishes be known ahead of time frequently they wouldn't have been interested in heroic measures and,1,0
sw4047A-ms98-a,2,A,5.323375,14.85275,9.529375,m- my feeling by the way is that i think there is a need for capital punishment i don't think it ought to be applied to every crime obviously but there is a need how do you feel about it,1,0
sw4047A-ms98-a,7,A,40.3945,50.550625,10.156125,yeah i think it does does get uh strung out too long that they uh they keep people there ten twelve years uh uh that seems to be the norm,1,0
sw4047A-ms98-a,15,A,102.685875,105.6955,3.009625,i think one interesting question would be uh,1,0
sw4047A-ms98-a,22,A,162.98375,175.081,12.09725,that person probably isn't thinking too much about it but these major drug dealers uh you know they got some brains they wouldn't be in the business if they didn't have and if they're threatened with the death penalty i think it might make a difference on them_1,1,0
sw4047B-ms98-a,2,B,14.116375,22.939125,8.82275,oh i believe there i- you know there is a need for it like you said it shouldn't be applied to every every crime you know,1,0
sw4047B-ms98-a,38,B,236.104375,244.08375,7.979375,i think drug dealers need to be sent to prison for life imprisonment and stuff you know or given the death penalty,1,0
sw4048A-ms98-a,20,A,89.465875,96.504,7.038125,well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use but still it can be dangerous,1,0
sw4048A-ms98-a,48,A,237.6265,246.2775,8.651,i've met one employee i know when i was working with he had alcohol on his breath and i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not that'd be just as dangerous,1,0
sw4048B-ms98-a,18,B,75.797375,81.109375,5.312, that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on ,1,0
sw4048B-ms98-a,45,B,227.03925,235.294875,8.255625,so uh i'd rather have that than you know say well this week the A's and B's are going to be in and next week C's and  are going to come in ,1,0
sw4049A-ms98-a,27,A,188.99725,196.88625,7.889,yeah well like you say i mean if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing,1,0
sw4049A-ms98-a,28,A,196.88625,203.6555,6.76925,i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors,1,0
sw4049A-ms98-a,34,A,241.94475,246.297875,4.353125,well do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this or,1,0
sw4049B-ms98-a,9,B,58.885625,70.106875,11.22125,there's too many cases where it can you know there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing i don't think there's any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs so we don't want him here,1,0
sw4049B-ms98-a,11,B,71.81825,79.908375,8.090125,like i said some industries though i think it'd be very necessary i wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i'm flying in an airplane,1,0
sw4049B-ms98-a,12,B,79.908375,93.07825,13.169875,but uh i mean i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that it's such a a big deal i mean if your employer's not going to trust you or you know it i just i think it's a whole trust issue i just can't see it,1,0
sw4049B-ms98-a,29,B,175.649,189.240625,13.591625,i mean the during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there i think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also,2,0
sw4049B-ms98-a,40,B,245.531375,257.706,12.174625,uh i really think it should be except as i've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times,1,0
sw4049B-ms98-a,41,B,257.706,264.309125,6.603125,and other than that i think i do not think it should be allowable i think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that,2,0
sw4051B-ms98-a,6,B,34.1515,47.700375,13.548875,right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive uh they could be made uh you know che- inexpensive and lots of it,1,0
sw4051B-ms98-a,17,B,98.8085,101.306375,2.497875,it's gonna be quite a while before we can uh,1,0
sw4051B-ms98-a,20,B,125.023375,138.840625,13.81725,have us uh as a an un- the part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into uh the new nonpolluting uh compound,2,0
sw4051B-ms98-a,27,B,169.63475,184.453,14.81825,and uh the only reason i didn't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree,1,0
sw4051B-ms98-a,45,B,268.619,272.243,3.624,diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily,1,0
sw4052A-ms98-a,10,A,22.314,30.38275,8.06875,i do i have uh one son who will be three in May and uh we're expecting another in May,1,0
sw4052A-ms98-a,38,A,136.460375,142.82675,6.366375,yeah it sounds like we'll be doing something similar and my wife was thinking of uh starting up a little preschool,1,0
sw4052A-ms98-a,39,A,142.82675,149.476125,6.649375,maybe just with a few other mothers and it would be sort of a mom it would end up being a mom's day off thing because_1 they would take turns ,1,0
sw4052A-ms98-a,54,A,184.183,185.718875,1.535875,it would be,1,0
sw4052A-ms98-a,65,A,211.56375,214.24275,2.679,wait a minute this should be very simple,1,0
sw4053A-ms98-a,67,A,287.133875,298.53,11.396125,biked and how many calories it's burned and you can set it up where um you can be going up hills or you can just be going just constant level and so it's ,2,0
sw4054A-ms98-a,18,A,106.86325,118.00625,11.143,employee turnover health problems and accidents and theft and i understand that certain jobs like if you're driving a train or plane or something of course there'd be increased need for it,1,0
sw4054A-ms98-a,41,A,227.28375,236.440375,9.156625,you know a an attorney knows they get in front of a jury and the jury will be thinking well i've done that before or he's just a good old boy   ,1,0
sw4054B-ms98-a,13,B,55.998375,59.97125,3.972875,not be too great um,1,0
sw4054B-ms98-a,24,B,93.584875,97.73125,4.146375,but like anything else this can be misused,1,0
sw4054B-ms98-a,47,B,261.2675,269.6705,8.403,they're not hurting anyone else and i thought where have i heard this  and i'm afraid that's what we may be,1,0
sw4055A-ms98-a,20,A,72.719625,85.780625,13.061,on a anniversary camp out and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains,1,0
sw4055A-ms98-a,24,A,102.2515,108.293875,6.042375,so this year they'll both be going and so that's been real enjoyable for them,1,0
sw4055A-ms98-a,31,A,139.13775,143.33025,4.1925,and this year i believe it will be in tents also,1,0
sw4055B-ms98-a,53,B,271.489125,275.5465,4.057375,and so that that uh that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away,1,0
sw4056A-ms98-a,34,A,155.379,165.38,10.001,and they basically made a cutoff about six hundred and eighty seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care and and the ones above would,1,0
sw4056A-ms98-a,38,A,177.15775,184.694125,7.536375,uh the pressing one but i'll tell you i- i- i don't mind having dental you know uh sometimes dental costs can be ,1,0
sw4056B-ms98-a,25,B,111.400625,119.6645,8.263875,well i think uh the the health care of course is is an important in has to be the single most important benefit ,1,0
sw4056B-ms98-a,53,B,241.994875,250.288875,8.294,considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which i belong to,1,0
sw4057A-ms98-a,45,A,219.3315,229.73625,10.40475,well i- i- i guess i'm not i don't like to make hard and fast rules that you have to live by because_1 there's always exceptions but i think something has to be done some type of reform measure,1,0
sw4057B-ms98-a,16,B,44.20525,48.117375,3.912125,yeah so i guess we should be grateful that it's as low as it is,1,0
sw4057B-ms98-a,20,B,62.092625,69.700125,7.6075,and so they everything is subsidized by their government their their taxes are higher than ours so i guess i shouldn't be i shouldn't complain so much,1,0
sw4057B-ms98-a,48,B,229.360125,232.419,3.058875,he certainly seems to be looking at the right issue,1,0
sw4057B-ms98-a,52,B,252.108375,261.231125,9.12275,but i think it'd be fascinating to see him try vetoing some of the one of these rider bills that's that's clearly a waste of money and to see how Congress reacts to that,1,0
sw4057B-ms98-a,53,B,261.231125,263.645,2.413875,that'd be quite an exciting battle,1,0
sw4058A-ms98-a,11,A,51.833625,54.508875,2.67525,and that way it can be a d- a deterrent,1,0
sw4058A-ms98-a,52,A,276.922625,284.49375,7.571125,and the and the individual's guilty i believe that if we have cash capital punishment that it should be executed swiftly,1,0
sw4058A-ms98-a,53,A,284.49375,293.99825,9.5045,that it should uh be taken care of not after seven levels of appeal but after a couple levels app- of appeal,1,0
sw4058A-ms98-a,55,A,297.229125,299.17,1.940875,those circumstances would be,1,0
sw4058B-ms98-a,6,B,35.557375,45.8265,10.269125,if if the penalty could be executed swiftly and surely upon people who deserved it when there was uh evidence uh beyond a,1,0
sw4058B-ms98-a,7,B,45.8265,51.868625,6.042125,a reasonable doubt that they had committed a a crime worthy of it then i think it should be done,1,0
sw4058B-ms98-a,11,B,70.75825,84.852625,14.094375,this last technicality was simply because the language of the decision handed down by the jury uh ex- uh saying that he should get the death penalty was not precisely as it is stated in the statute that it should be,1,0
sw4058B-ms98-a,24,B,161.248125,170.65775,9.409625,that just shouldn't be so  but  so i say uh you know i could tolerate getting rid of the death penalty if we could have life without the possibility of parole ,1,0
sw4059A-ms98-a,60,A,217.52075,221.717125,4.196375,but caring for an elderly person who might be forgetful,1,0
sw4059B-ms98-a,19,B,68.5005,70.583625,2.083125,that seems to be,1,0
sw4059B-ms98-a,78,B,281.934625,288.8075,6.872875,turn her over to a nursing home i i'd like to be in and  i think that's the position of a lot of people but they can't afford it ,1,0
sw4060B-ms98-a,24,B,112.159,115.509625,3.350625,that use to be i think a couple of years ago but i don't know,1,0
sw4060B-ms98-a,60,B,284.516625,289.716875,5.20025,whereas yeah in a smaller i think you'd be more willing to either help that person or help it,1,0
sw4062B-ms98-a,39,B,237.007625,247.583875,10.57625,sort of keeps uh i guess you would say a running record of it so that he he knows at what point uh we are going to be able to to have uh some extra money,1,0
sw4063A-ms98-a,70,A,281.687,285.42,3.733,be with the kids a little bit during that time and,1,0
sw4063B-ms98-a,5,B,12.956875,25.1205,12.163625,it's it's not as easy as i had thought it would be but last year i started keeping a total of our expenses and and where they were all going and i have uh a budget book that i use,1,0
sw4063B-ms98-a,6,B,25.1205,29.05275,3.93225,if you had a people that have personal computers it would be much easier,1,0
sw4063B-ms98-a,20,B,109.99825,114.656625,4.658375,because to me that's the only way we're ever going s- to be able to save,1,0
sw4063B-ms98-a,31,B,158.50425,166.613375,8.109125,kids his age are ready to go to college it's gonna be about seventy thousand dollars a year for college,1,0
sw4063B-ms98-a,43,B,229.2,240.0005,10.8005,yeah because i i've got a friend that just graduated and took her test to to be an R N and i i think towards the last year they were working at the hospitals and then they all had to buy all the uniforms and,1,0
sw4064A-ms98-a,12,A,47.504625,53.9605,6.455875,the other thing the other thing that really bothers me about that is i think you know that a judge can be,1,0
sw4064A-ms98-a,36,A,171.087375,174.5065,3.419125,i think i think that there'd that there'd be a large variation in,1,0
sw4065A-ms98-a,42,A,191.76025,199.08675,7.3265,i don't like knowing that there might be an alcoholic who is flying my plane or or you know cutting into my body,1,0
sw4065A-ms98-a,56,A,263.189125,275.033625,11.8445,accept the responsibility or are we able to test things now that never could be tested before so therefore we're using technology in a way that wasn't available before,1,0
sw4065B-ms98-a,2,B,4.44,15.0735,10.6335,well i- i think my feelings on it are it depends i think if it's necessary if you have the kind of job that it it requires you to always be,1,0
sw4065B-ms98-a,4,B,24.571875,30.675375,6.1035,that's what i think as far as you are required to not only be at work when you're not at work,1,0
sw4065B-ms98-a,6,B,34.192875,42.924125,8.73125,yeah people who who could be at work at any time or whose decisions could be clouded if they had to make a decision,2,0
sw4065B-ms98-a,12,B,66.313625,74.045,7.731375,if they were to decide that you shouldn't be drinking w- would they just you know i mean y- you have to draw the line somewhere i think and give people,1,0
sw4065B-ms98-a,17,B,102.6145,110.18875,7.57425,come back and and get you anytime you know i- i don't think it it could be surprise at your door here we are   or,1,0
sw4065B-ms98-a,43,B,197.868125,205.345625,7.4775,yeah exactly you don't want your doctor coming in hung over if he's gonna be cutting on you that day that's for sure so,1,0
sw4065B-ms98-a,45,B,211.913875,217.00425,5.090375,you but i guess that's  more or less forcing you to be personally responsible for yourself,1,0
sw4065B-ms98-a,46,B,217.00425,230.20175,13.1975,it's basically all they're trying to do with that then if you want to  if you look at it that way because you would think your doctor wouldn't be out drinking the night before but but if he thought he could get caught doing it then he certainly wouldn't do it as opposed to well,1,0
sw4065B-ms98-a,49,B,237.448,251.1645,13.7165, yeah it's just a gallbladder it ain't  you know no problem yeah i guess that's j- uh that's basically what they're doing then just forcing you to be responsible but i guess some people have to be forced so ,2,0
sw4066A-ms98-a,53,A,260.485375,263.094875,2.6095,well could be ,1,0
sw4066B-ms98-a,3,B,4.382125,15.455875,11.07375,you were suppose to you talk about capital punishment how does the law what uh how do the laws in the different states compare and to be restricted to certain crimes or certain circumstances or something like that ,1,0
sw4066B-ms98-a,33,B,228.342125,232.663125,4.321,i guess that would be that would be the issue and they just tie the child and and ,2,0
sw4067A-ms98-a,33,A,184.789625,195.205375,10.41575,uh you know she's getting to the point where she almost can't be in a nursing home she spent some time with my parents some time now she's with an uncle of mine living with them,1,0
sw4067A-ms98-a,41,A,242.191375,252.68625,10.494875,and so her memory is very poor  and so she can't really be on her own but she can still do things by herself but you just have to uh kind of direct her ,1,0
sw4068A-ms98-a,22,A,86.503,89.393,2.89,would be deterred,1,0
sw4068A-ms98-a,23,A,89.393,93.700875,4.307875,by capital punishment would also be deterred by life in prison,1,0
sw4068A-ms98-a,38,A,146.988125,149.4335,2.445375,do you think it would be a deterrent,1,0
sw4068A-ms98-a,44,A,169.283375,173.737875,4.4545,oh i see you're thinking that if the laws were enforced in general people would be,1,0
sw4068A-ms98-a,45,A,173.737875,177.57875,3.840875, maybe people would be stopped at doing something before they got to the point of,1,0
sw4068A-ms98-a,64,A,246.109625,257.1285,11.018875,are there certain you know i mean are there certain crimes or do you think there are or should be certain crimes that are liable for it and others not i mean clearly there are but which ones do you think should be liable,2,0
sw4068B-ms98-a,14,B,73.686625,80.112375,6.42575,yeah could be could be how do you feel about about the capital punishment,2,0
sw4068B-ms98-a,20,B,127.66675,137.267875,9.601125,i- it shouldn't be um there should be more safe guards to be sure that that you're you know no mistakes have been made ,3,0
sw4068B-ms98-a,44,B,282.516875,291.90475,9.387875,if you could put them_1 away and be assured that they would stay there you know where they couldn't hurt anybody else that'd be one thing but,2,0
sw4071A-ms98-a,41,A,194.97975,203.547875,8.568125,uh ten percent or thirteen percent there would be no figuring i mean you would take your income tax you'd have a certain amou- i mean you you take your total salary,1,0
sw4071A-ms98-a,42,A,203.547875,211.683625,8.13575,uh those who made under a certain amount wouldn't h- owe any taxes and then there'd be a set amount for however many people you know dependents you had,1,0
sw4071A-ms98-a,46,A,230.87575,240.54625,9.6705,i i'd like to see something like that yeah i think it would be fairer and uh it would put a l- you know a lot of the tax attorneys out of business and i'm sure they'll fight it tooth and nail but,1,0
sw4071A-ms98-a,47,A,240.54625,245.076,4.52975,i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans,1,0
sw4071B-ms98-a,43,B,227.706,230.806875,3.100875,yeah that could be nice ,1,0
sw4072A-ms98-a,27,A,125.960625,130.580625,4.62,probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers,1,0
sw4072B-ms98-a,68,B,238.035375,242.318375,4.283,um  you know even the national news i just find it to be you know,1,0
sw4073B-ms98-a,8,B,23.348,30.463125,7.115125,Dallas is talking about starting something like that too it's going to be i i don't know if it's three dollars a week i think it's three dollars a month,1,0
sw4073B-ms98-a,11,B,41.54325,51.1125,9.56925,maybe not a lot but i use to be able to find a place that i could get you know a penny a pound for glass and a couple of pennies a pound for plastic and,1,0
sw4073B-ms98-a,30,B,149.957875,159.850625,9.89275,well i use to it use to be a good deal us to gi- instead of giving my kids an allowance i just told them they could go around the neighborhood and collect things to be recycled and then i would drive them over and,2,0
sw4073B-ms98-a,39,B,224.710875,233.668875,8.958,well or if it has to be separated by number why doesn't someone take it i mean i can't find it's i can't even find somewhere that will take the stuff,1,0
sw4073B-ms98-a,41,B,235.169,248.87875,13.70975,yeah and i i think maybe one thing that we could do to encourage it would be to require uh you know government agencies and stuff were required to use only recycled paper for instance,1,0
sw4074A-ms98-a,44,A,176.6085,182.9345,6.326,i don't know they seem to be i mean listen better or something is your cat a purebred,1,0
sw4074B-ms98-a,47,B,165.064125,168.367375,3.30325,and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs,1,0
sw4075A-ms98-a,3,A,21.460875,26.432875,4.972,i don't happen to be in the part of the city that does that ,1,0
sw4075B-ms98-a,13,B,75.312625,77.372625,2.06,it use to be a firehouse,1,0
sw4076A-ms98-a,19,A,62.312,66.734,4.422,was it -as it wages was it a loan that needed to be paid back,1,0
sw4076A-ms98-a,32,A,113.21325,118.87825,5.665,i guess i guess all they can do is knock off the people they think would be most biased against them,1,0
sw4076A-ms98-a,37,A,132.705875,136.862375,4.1565,it could be it could be worse i- i find it hard to think of something better ,2,0
sw4076A-ms98-a,51,A,202.94575,214.261125,11.315375,yeah it would almost be as if if it if they could somehow say hey having an opinion's okay it's being willing to change it that's important thing ,1,0
sw4076A-ms98-a,66,A,259.96525,265.48725,5.522,you would be biased in favor of which ever party you identified with,1,0
sw4076B-ms98-a,3,B,2.13575,12.521375,10.385625,uh no i've never been  called for jury duty which i'm kind of glad for i think it it'd be   nice to actually experience it uh but no i haven't i have never how about_1 you,1,0
sw4076B-ms98-a,45,B,175.45025,183.639875,8.189625,and it it uh it just seems like  the people that they're going to end up with have got to be just your basic you know schmucks,1,0
sw4076B-ms98-a,47,B,191.229,204.445875,13.216875,it just seems like tho- i guess that's the one thing that i  think is wrong with it i don't know what you'd about it but those people are are not going to be i mean if they haven't formed some sort of opinion i don't uh i don't know what i'm trying to say really but it just,1,0
sw4076B-ms98-a,49,B,211.673375,213.50725,1.833875,that's right be-,1,0
sw4076B-ms98-a,50,B,213.50725,227.444625,13.937375,because having not formed an opinion to me says something about the people themselves well either they sit in a little hole you know for all their life and don't hear about anything going on in the world and i don't see how somebody like that is going to be a very good uh,1,0
sw4076B-ms98-a,51,B,227.444625,231.566125,4.1215,i don't kn- f- form be able to form a very coherent opinion about,1,0
sw4076B-ms98-a,53,B,233.346875,239.066375,5.7195,r-   and that seems to be the opposite of what they they actually have to look for,1,0
sw4076B-ms98-a,66,B,264.253625,275.010875,10.75725,right and as far as the i don't think that the uh sentencing should be left up to the judge because that just that w- that gives too much power to any one person ,1,0
sw4076B-ms98-a,70,B,279.13425,291.014875,11.880625,yeah that just i mean for for one person i'm s- sure they have studied the law and ha- been involved in it for so long but still i think it's this is suppose to be a system of government by the people even though that's kind of a joke,1,0
sw4076B-ms98-a,71,B,291.014875,299.554,8.539125,but it still seems that the people ought to be the ones the crime was against society it ought to be society as a whole you know tha- uh as represented by the jury,2,0
sw4077A-ms98-a,10,A,23.97775,29.8165,5.83875,you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know,1,0
sw4077A-ms98-a,21,A,53.313,59.260625,5.947625,uh and i know i know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before,1,0
sw4077A-ms98-a,22,A,59.260625,65.376125,6.1155, you know be be obviously insane and then you you know but have your legal right to get a gun,2,0
sw4077A-ms98-a,78,A,261.764375,271.498125,9.73375,you you you you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that    danger to them and then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know ,1,0
sw4077B-ms98-a,3,B,3.266625,5.62575,2.359125,i mean i don't think that guns should be outlawed,1,0
sw4077B-ms98-a,19,B,78.4255,80.326,1.9005,  i would probably be,1,0
sw4077B-ms98-a,51,B,231.99975,236.258125,4.258375,so i finally ended up giving it back to him i said i don't want it i don't want to be responsible for it because,1,0
sw4077B-ms98-a,52,B,236.258125,242.301375,6.04325,you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if i am not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn i don't need it,1,0
sw4077B-ms98-a,69,B,297.509125,299.714,2.204875,i would be scared selling guns to people,1,0
sw4078A-ms98-a,7,A,25.497,29.604375,4.107375,oh yeah wha- what would be more efficient about it wha- wha-,1,0
sw4078B-ms98-a,12,B,63.0725,73.43425,10.36175,uh i think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we're paying for them to to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step,1,0
sw4078B-ms98-a,51,B,280.862875,292.80025,11.937375,so you know that's just where i probably need to be a little more responsible as a citizen wise you know looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start,1,0
sw4079A-ms98-a,42,A,226.091125,230.996125,4.905,but if you're rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that,1,0
sw4079A-ms98-a,50,A,282.374,286.10625,3.73225,and i'm hoping i'll be have a slow period before i need that again ,1,0
sw4079B-ms98-a,23,B,86.9365,95.26825,8.33175,you know we we planned out how much we're going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and,1,0
sw4079B-ms98-a,37,B,184.374,195.708875,11.334875,we're on a schedule where i try every uh three or four years to to buy a new one and you know i'm constantly making car payments but i figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments,1,0
sw4080A-ms98-a,7,A,13.733375,18.885125,5.15175,you know even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place you know,1,0
sw4080A-ms98-a,61,A,185.905875,193.22525,7.319375,that's not a bad idea but then again you can always get around that you could go through the black market like you say you know you always will be able to get around,1,0
sw4080A-ms98-a,66,A,199.0045,203.442125,4.437625,i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like,1,0
sw4081A-ms98-a,49,A,230.853,241.256125,10.403125, yeah that's an interesting term because i mean if you if you think about it's the garbage truck well is it really garbage if they're taking it off to be recycled and somebody's willing to pay for it,1,0
sw4081B-ms98-a,41,B,266.02975,273.156625,7.126875,that that should be more available we should have more containers in all city uh uh and all the grocery stores,1,0
sw4082A-ms98-a,41,A,258.26325,266.290875,8.027625, did you did you think that CNN well the Gulf War coverage would be kind of uh uh abnormality i just won- i guess,1,0
sw4082A-ms98-a,42,A,266.290875,273.495125,7.20425,i'd be curious to know what you thought as to as to how like say CNN TV news compared to the three networks,1,0
sw4082B-ms98-a,22,B,174.092875,178.232375,4.1395,an expert in i find their descriptions to be,1,0
sw4083A-ms98-a,15,A,100.260125,107.472375,7.21225,yeah it always should be mandatory for some uh positions such as those but um,1,0
sw4083A-ms98-a,17,A,129.873375,142.441625,12.56825,that's true that's true you there has to be that's the that's the key i think is is what happens when you find a person who is on drugs you got to just that's when you have to be careful you know you just can't,2,0
sw4083A-ms98-a,18,A,142.441625,146.566625,4.125,fire every person something needs to be done to help these kind of these people,1,0
sw4083A-ms98-a,22,A,159.8305,167.2685,7.438,right there should be some sort of program they can go into to try to clean themselves up and be given a second chance,2,0
sw4083A-ms98-a,44,A,280.435875,290.110625,9.67475,right yeah you can't really do that you could be hiring someone for uh uh a managerial white collar position in your company and uh the person can appear very,1,0
sw4083A-ms98-a,45,A,290.110625,296.389,6.278375,well qualified and and perfectly normal but uh they may be having a lot more problems,1,0
sw4083B-ms98-a,6,B,20.7965,29.476875,8.680375,that could cause all kind of problems i'd would like to see it see them be able to not need to screen more than i would like to see them screening,1,0
sw4083B-ms98-a,8,B,33.65725,43.56625,9.909,right i think that we ought to be  employer certainly has the right to say on the application are you on drugs or something like that,1,0
sw4083B-ms98-a,18,B,91.62975,101.37375,9.744,actually  does um routine screening for their workers and that might not be a bad idea i've see a couple that look like they might be on drugs,2,0
sw4083B-ms98-a,28,B,117.849,130.401,12.552,obviously an employer doesn't wanna have a person on drugs but if somebody's on drugs and they get into the work place it might be uh a better thing for them than to have them_1 out there on the street mugging people,1,0
sw4083B-ms98-a,33,B,154.161125,160.491,6.329875,if they ever tested uh positive on drugs then they'd if that were the case then they'd be always unemployed,1,0
sw4083B-ms98-a,39,B,180.4365,191.68125,11.24475,but on the other si- hand it's they need to be around people that have their lives together and aren't on drugs they need to be you know people wouldn't be getting into trouble as much if they,3,0
sw4084A-ms98-a,3,A,3.994625,12.4195,8.424875,oh yeah  well i've got preschoolers so we have one that is going to be starting kindergarten next year and uh,1,0
sw4084A-ms98-a,19,A,91.939625,103.5405,11.600875,they're taking the role of the parent and trying to teach a lot of uh of values and doing a lot of baby sitting and and not getting down to what they need to be teaching,1,0
sw4084A-ms98-a,28,A,172.119375,186.26525,14.145875,um they're going to have to use those a lot and and that way a child that my son already know already knows how to read and he will be able to excel at his own pace where the kids that you know,1,0
sw4084A-ms98-a,30,A,187.544125,194.791625,7.2475,you know that haven't had the he has a real desire to learn and hopefully he will be challenged throughout,1,0
sw4084B-ms98-a,16,B,36.527375,40.943,4.415625,i think there's a lot that could be done to improve them_1 i uh,1,0
sw4084B-ms98-a,18,B,47.010125,56.214375,9.20425,that we ought to be doing a lot of the things that a- that are done in college i guess should be taught a lot earlier in school like in math and science and stuff like that,2,0
sw4084B-ms98-a,20,B,64.4365,70.617125,6.180625,and i believe that that's the way that it used to be in this country a long time ago and that it probably is in a lot of other countries too because your,1,0
sw4084B-ms98-a,51,B,260.7225,268.425375,7.702875,hard core curriculum and into areas that are more should be dealt with at home or in the Church or somewhere else,1,0
sw4084B-ms98-a,53,B,280.60375,286.680375,6.076625,uh i don't know what they are trying to do but i really think that the emphasis should be more on on book learning and not,1,0
sw4084B-ms98-a,54,B,286.680375,294.09325,7.412875,on okay you know here's our civics class this is we're going to talk about how people deal with each other in their community and how it's suppose to be and,1,0
sw4085A-ms98-a,27,A,96.31225,101.41925,5.107,because  you know you're family doctor may not happen to be in the network,1,0
sw4085A-ms98-a,41,A,198.03125,203.637,5.60575,well i don't know i i would i'd be interested in see- in learning more about that because,1,0
sw4085B-ms98-a,18,B,65.327125,68.572625,3.2455,and i wouldn't be real surprised if that's the case um,1,0
sw4085B-ms98-a,39,B,133.40725,146.296875,12.889625,wonder about the economics of that uh the uh you know twenty years ago when HMO's just got started uh when they started enrolling a lot of people uh it was felt that this would be the way to control health care costs,1,0
sw4085B-ms98-a,53,B,211.340875,216.977,5.636125,well i i don't know i mean the questions is should should it be the employer that pays for child care uh,1,0
sw4085B-ms98-a,54,B,216.977,231.92075,14.94375,if if there were a tax credit then everybody would get it regardless who they worked for and you you would also be better in the sense that that people who had only one income in the family would get as much as people who had two and you would sort of think that the people who have one income kind of need it more ,1,0
sw4085B-ms98-a,67,B,286.578875,295.777875,9.199,uh but not everybody is like that and people who have kids that need uh you know an orthodontist services certainly would not be in that situation,1,0
sw4086A-ms98-a,27,A,112.509,123.5865,11.0775,and uh i anticipate getting a full time job soon so  you know probably one of those things where i really don't need the the hauling capacity much i'll be a little more stable but,1,0
sw4086A-ms98-a,38,A,164.528875,173.7185,9.189625,um-hum oh that'd be a definite yeah that'd be the way to go for sure i think there's no questions in in in terms of whether i would have that or not i,2,0
sw4086B-ms98-a,10,B,52.780625,67.54975,14.769125,well well when we  i guess this is talking about previous cars opposed to to next car but when we went to look for a mini van i wanted to get you know i thought it'd be nice to buy American and i went and looked at all the American ones,1,0
sw4086B-ms98-a,11,B,67.54975,77.12,9.57025,and the doors didn't close right and the i mean and this is on the lot and you're thinking   if it's not right now     be like after i've had it for six ,1,0
sw4086B-ms98-a,40,B,206.418375,212.650875,6.2325,sitting in behind our house and the kids are convinced the older two kids are convinced that that's going to be their cars,1,0
sw4086B-ms98-a,45,B,236.57225,238.563625,1.991375,it's suppposed to be,1,0
sw4087A-ms98-a,14,A,77.394375,82.2595,4.865125,no it's really scary and there does seem to be more and more of that if people are doing it,1,0
sw4087A-ms98-a,19,A,99.90675,104.15175,4.245,people with criminal records etcetera i think it would be very frightening ,1,0
sw4087A-ms98-a,31,A,150.75025,154.677125,3.926875,what what to look for what's what's going to be uh what's going to be,2,0
sw4087A-ms98-a,37,A,178.2775,182.962125,4.684625,no i think it's going to be hard i feel like i was i was lucky to get to be at home and,2,0
sw4087A-ms98-a,40,A,194.0695,197.22175,3.15225,it felt good to be there when they got home from school,1,0
sw4087B-ms98-a,49,B,168.40725,172.792875,4.385625,with some people say  it's not healthy for your children to be in day care,1,0
sw4088A-ms98-a,2,A,10.490875,22.674,12.183125,of government agencies and companies be tested especially when it effects public safety i mean the military obviously uh people that run trains and airplanes and and the like,1,0
sw4088A-ms98-a,52,A,285.131125,293.541375,8.41025,uh should be subject to the testing i guess that's probably the the way i'd term it and i'm talking about bus drivers as you mentioned and pilots and what have you,1,0
sw4088B-ms98-a,13,B,88.58275,98.1885,9.60575,uh that those would be something that should continue to have uh drug testing of course it is certainly not acceptable for an Eastern pilot to,1,0
sw4088B-ms98-a,24,B,148.67325,155.517625,6.844375,i think it might be inappropriate for us to say for me to say that in any in any industry,1,0
sw4088B-ms98-a,31,B,206.778125,212.676625,5.8985,for a long period of time but the ability for you to function seems to be,1,0
sw4089A-ms98-a,12,A,33.419875,42.520625,9.10075,and you know it's generally you know it's it it's quite often you know be a very hazy sort of day you know because there'll just be this pollution hanging in the air,2,0
sw4089A-ms98-a,67,A,235.1735,237.89125,2.71775,you know be the hardest be the m- biggest polluters,2,0
sw4089B-ms98-a,24,B,150.2185,155.464125,5.245625,you know to uh ba- kind of balance out he says if it's not air pollution it'll be,1,0
sw4089B-ms98-a,25,B,155.464125,166.865875,11.40175,it will be uh congestion or price of land or something like that so what i'm looking at here in the Portland area is is a temporary situation it's a very desirable area as far as i'm concerned and uh,1,0
sw4090B-ms98-a,32,B,156.779,161.52575,4.74675,thought it to be really helpful we've gotten some of our loans paid off early,1,0
sw4091A-ms98-a,12,A,44.128875,52.38975,8.260875,the only down side is they do it as a withholding off your uh income so you got to kind of you know be willing to squirrel away at whatever you wanna do,1,0
sw4091A-ms98-a,38,A,124.17375,135.05275,10.879,but um i chose to go into the stock program because you can't lose on it and you know i can always take the money off of that if i wasn't saving up for the house i would be putting money into a 401K,1,0
sw4091A-ms98-a,46,A,175.94575,187.973125,12.027375,the only problem with 125K is you got to say at the beginning of the year i think i'm gonna have a thousand dollars of expenses this year and then you have to be willing to have that money deducted from your salary and if you don't use the thousand dollars it goes away,1,0
sw4091B-ms98-a,51,B,274.961875,288.4765,13.514625,i'm i've learned so much about computer systems and sharing of information all these managerial type things that i never thought i'd be involved with and if i was in private practice i'd never be able to learn all that stuff,2,0
sw4092A-ms98-a,105,A,272.2515,277.0695,4.818, i prefer my my performers to be pretty sober you know just,1,0
sw4093A-ms98-a,24,A,119.54625,132.113375,12.567125,he uh he was drummed out of the Air Force and he spent i think something like seven years working you know before he was able to work his way back through the the courts to be uh,1,0
sw4093A-ms98-a,61,A,272.74,286.42775,13.68775, you know and  and i'm beginning to i'm i'm i'm starting to think a little more a little more about this is that i guess should we really be talking about  what should we be should we have legalized drugs ,2,0
sw4093B-ms98-a,23,B,92.1655,94.4845,2.319,right and you'll be penalized,1,0
sw4093B-ms98-a,50,B,186.521375,190.75825,4.236875,and i think that what they should be doing is performance testing,1,0
sw4093B-ms98-a,56,B,211.2405,218.085875,6.845375,you know uh using some legal drug that they don't test for i mean i really don't want to be i don't want to die in a train wreck,1,0
sw4093B-ms98-a,59,B,231.819375,240.4325,8.613125,well i can see there be yeah i mean i actually it's some some mixed mixed feeling about feel i mean i feel like okay if you're going to do testing do a meaningful test like a performance test ,1,0
sw4094A-ms98-a,36,A,159.754,172.990125,13.236125, if if it's death let's get it over and done with uh the appeal process should be speeded up quite qui- quite quickly they had this guy on the  news that's been around since seventy six and he's cost us over four million dollars so far,1,0
sw4094A-ms98-a,37,A,172.990125,186.7315,13.741375,uh let's speed it up be sure it's as close to being accurate as possible and get it over and done with on the other hand it may not be capital punishment if you committed armed robbery and get caught you shouldn't be out you shouldn't serve one day and get credit for five or or ten days,3,0
sw4094A-ms98-a,58,A,250.076375,256.90725,6.830875,as a Christian i can't even be the devil's adv- i'm a Christian and i still think there's an appropriate place for it,1,0
sw4094B-ms98-a,28,B,146.375875,155.00125,8.625375,have more than just a couple people in there to make sure that it's done and it should be i think it should be done as painlessly and just done as nicely as it can be,3,0
sw4094B-ms98-a,33,B,188.849625,194.921375,6.07175,oh i think that there should be capital punishment even for other things i think somebody that's caught selling drugs,1,0
sw4094B-ms98-a,34,B,194.921375,204.58275,9.661375,if that shouldn't be capital punishment but if they're the high ones that are making these drugs and importing them i think that you could consider that because in essence they're taking lives,1,0
sw4094B-ms98-a,44,B,225.51425,233.7085,8.19425,i think that i don't know it's hard you don't want to be so mean that you're you're doing away with people that have a chance to change,1,0
sw4095A-ms98-a,32,A,181.77225,194.4165,12.64425,yeah that's an adventure i think it's gonna be harder on mom than it's  than it is on him but yeah it's like oh i can't send my baby to school  it's just yeah it's like i can't believe i you know he's ,1,0
sw4095A-ms98-a,33,A,194.4165,203.032125,8.615625,he's he'll be five in in July and it's just hard to believe that you know time has has flown by so quick so yeah,1,0

sw4096A-ms98-a,9,A,22.886125,30.076625,7.1905,had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste,1,0
sw4096B-ms98-a,26,B,157.493,163.0355,5.5425,right there has to be a a reuse for it i mean that's why they recycle,1,0
sw4096B-ms98-a,27,B,163.0355,172.3385,9.303,the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that  uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers,1,0
sw4097A-ms98-a,15,A,95.0035,100.941125,5.937625,i would think that they would try like to try and find her some place that first of all she could be happy,1,0
sw4097A-ms98-a,31,A,200.371375,208.830375,8.459,so they want to really make a a a a method of it i wish that we could find some place for for my grandmother she'd be happier ,1,0
sw4097A-ms98-a,33,A,218.420625,228.957125,10.5365,and and that the stress is just enormous i i feel for you you're you're one step closer than i am to it and it must be it must be really draining on you,2,0
sw4097A-ms98-a,45,A,266.156625,275.359,9.202375,yeah yeah i can i can appreciate that and there's  the- there use to be programs in some of the more progressive communities of of of house mates ,1,0

sw4097A-ms98-a,48,A,286.403875,298.082,11.678125,uh trying to find a a day program that my grandmother would be willing to accept that she could go and spend the day meeting so- right now she tries to hold up in her apartment and the only people she,1,0
sw4097B-ms98-a,23,B,100.784875,109.05,8.265125,well that's that will be a problem because i have looked  and they all really amount to the same thing uh,1,0
sw4098A-ms98-a,43,A,124.04875,128.845375,4.796625,so uh you know what's going in -s got to be a lot more -an going out if it can pay for all that stuff ,1,0
sw4098A-ms98-a,47,A,138.0445,144.633875,6.589375,who is putting it in i'm just saying that what goes in must be a lot more than what comes out if there is left over for all these things,1,0
sw4098B-ms98-a,43,B,146.836,151.457,4.621,borrowed time actually could be could be borrowed time it's like,2,0
sw4099B-ms98-a,50,B,209.717625,213.133375,3.41575,because_1 i know that skiing in Utah is is suppose to be great,1,0
sw4100A-ms98-a,2,A,0.18,6.221625,6.041625,uh actually it turns out to be an interesting topic because i'm now in the middle of a job search graduating here,1,0
sw4100A-ms98-a,19,A,113.864875,125.68575,11.820875,the other things they do seem to be willing to spend money in strange ways for instance i know where my wife works she can get for something like five or ten dollars a month sole health insurance but ,1,0
sw4100B-ms98-a,11,B,96.2225,108.887125,12.664625,of coverages um uh uh there might there might be a lot of things that the company  is wi- willing to pay for but that you're simply not interested in and what you ra- prefer to do is say,1,0
sw4100B-ms98-a,20,B,171.09575,179.584625,8.488875,uh everyone tries to be the secondary carrier and it's very difficult to to get it worked out uh i know at at Hayes uh,1,0
sw4100B-ms98-a,31,B,283.212625,291.344,8.131375,uh in in some ways i think it's it would be very good thing uh you know to be able to get your wills done and,2,0
sw4101A-ms98-a,27,A,221.35525,229.26875,7.9135,Central C- uh well i want to say Central Canada but Central Canada tends to be referred more to Ontario and Quebec,1,0
sw4101B-ms98-a,17,B,190.940375,202.38825,11.447875,to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans and and i think it's mostly cans there may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not and they uh bring them_1 up to a one,1,0
sw4102A-ms98-a,15,A,63.101,72.00375,8.90275,i know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home but my daddy keeps talking about it i don't i couldn't possibly couldn't never see him in a nursing home,1,0
sw4102A-ms98-a,16,A,72.00375,79.32525,7.3215,and my grand daddy also doesn't like wouldn't want to be in a nursing home he's ninety,1,0
sw4102A-ms98-a,39,A,186.617,195.79125,9.17425,i don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients but just patients in  people in general who were not as independent as they use to be ,1,0
sw4102B-ms98-a,34,B,142.350625,150.265875,7.91525,in Dallas um yeah i've he- i've heard of several things and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them,1,0
sw4102B-ms98-a,35,B,150.265875,160.656375,10.3905,but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or uh to be able to get them there  for the day program and pick them up,1,0
sw4102B-ms98-a,50,B,228.436625,232.374,3.937375,because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those,2,0
sw4103A-ms98-a,32,A,144.513,148.57775,4.06475,find some extra i think payroll deductions probably the only way we'll be able to,1,0
sw4103A-ms98-a,36,A,153.13825,155.963625,2.825375,but uh it'll be interesting to see,1,0
sw4103A-ms98-a,50,A,195.19,201,5.81,i was kind of wondering if they'd be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that i don't know how many people,1,0
sw4103A-ms98-a,52,A,202,204.567875,2.567875,are uh going to be involved in this but,1,0
sw4103A-ms98-a,62,A,241.993875,245.009625,3.01575,yeah it'll be interesting to see what they ,1,0
sw4103A-ms98-a,64,A,246.020875,251.189375,5.1685,it'd be interesting to see how the data base  well i guess we're talking about the experiment and,1,0
sw4103B-ms98-a,4,B,18.083375,32.36675,14.283375,i considered using it once myself but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken at least for now,1,0
sw4103B-ms98-a,12,B,64.837625,72.954625,8.117,it doesn't really seem to be too too tight if we r- just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced,1,0
sw4103B-ms98-a,21,B,119.658,128.35175,8.69375,we're gonna be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall and then the money that i'll be making this summer we'll be,3,0
sw4103B-ms98-a,45,B,237.60725,241.9935,4.38625,it sounded like it'd be an interesting project to participate in so i,1,0
sw4104A-ms98-a,31,A,131.08325,134.819,3.73575,i see so overseas where would you be going,1,0
sw4104A-ms98-a,34,A,137.222375,139.34325,2.120875,really how long would you be there,1,0
sw4104B-ms98-a,23,B,84.6385,88.791125,4.152625,but we don't know how long it will be a dream,1,0
sw4104B-ms98-a,30,B,115.388125,123.693625,8.3055,and um it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota,1,0
sw4104B-ms98-a,46,B,170.01,181.523875,11.513875,um we will be i was over over for four years doing language surveying which is the first step you're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need and uh,1,0
sw4105A-ms98-a,16,A,171.098875,177.507625,6.40875,at eight thirty every day and i couldn't leave until five i- i think i'd be uh,1,0
sw4105B-ms98-a,17,B,111.7825,117.43425,5.65175,but i like to be very much into the active intramural sports that was important to me,1,0
sw4105B-ms98-a,37,B,275.855125,280.6665,4.811375,right because of the amount of amount of work that you had to be done,1,0
sw4106A-ms98-a,13,A,74.982,86.242875,11.260875,most of the time s- tends to be pretty slanted to the left and you just can't tell really what's happening for i mean take for example the economy where they've not not not them alone but,1,0
sw4106A-ms98-a,28,A,170.46925,178.736625,8.267375,that's about the only way to do it which i find kind of unfortunate now there is the McNeil Leh- Lehrer news hour but that's on TV and then you've got to be sitting there,1,0
sw4106A-ms98-a,35,A,208.368625,220.063625,11.695,so that's that's true yeah bu- now i like the Wall Street Journal if i subscribed well let's see if i subscribed to a newspaper i probably would get it it's it'd be that or USA Today but um,1,0
sw4107A-ms98-a,58,A,268.656375,278.737,10.080625,they do have reusable cups that people can uh i mean basically you've got carry around this cup if you want to if you want to be uh environmentally um conscious,1,0
sw4107B-ms98-a,23,B,196.321375,202.32575,6.004375,if i was use to just throwing things away it would be a really tough habit to unlearn,1,0
sw4107B-ms98-a,25,B,203.343125,209.07175,5.728625,so maybe you know the next generation -ill be a little bit more uh conscientious    ,1,0
sw4108A-ms98-a,37,A,136.364875,142.117875,5.753,but i think nursing homes can be good just depends on what kind they are you know an you need to check them_1 out,1,0
sw4108A-ms98-a,64,A,240.195875,243.233375,3.0375,um it'll be like family around her,1,0
sw4108B-ms98-a,7,B,29.69225,42.542125,12.849875,so sometimes it's not an alternative and i think uh but i think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time sometimes in a nursing home,1,0
sw4108B-ms98-a,40,B,272.1465,283.19925,11.05275,i think the the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the the uh elderly uh person who's going in,2,0
sw4108B-ms98-a,41,B,283.19925,288.271125,5.071875,and the family that's going to be uh effec- effected by it ,1,0
sw4108B-ms98-a,42,B,288.271125,298.306,10.034875, and uh you know sometimes it can those choi- those choices can be made in advance and sometimes the choices uh because of the nature of the illness when they're,1,0
sw4109A-ms98-a,15,A,66.62725,77.997125,11.369875,more recreation people would have time to do it there'd be less of a stress level we'd have le- we'd have less crime we'd have to we'd have to build less prisons we'd nee- you know less police force ,1,0
sw4109A-ms98-a,39,A,250.981125,264.8675,13.886375,whether you know it or not is that you're categorized some people can be let go and replaced like uh say uh a a typist uh somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone a receptionist,1,0
sw4109A-ms98-a,42,A,286.3555,294.996125,8.640625,is that to have knowledge when you have the knowledge you're you're not gonna um you know be let go you know be one of the last ones to let go anyway,2,0
sw4109B-ms98-a,4,B,7.459625,14.948125,7.4885,okay we can start off there let's just get started i don't wanna we- you know uh talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it ,1,0
sw4109B-ms98-a,16,B,77.94025,87.113875,9.173625,yeah it all makes sense to me although there may be more crime i mean if people have more leisure time it's not clear in that,1,0
sw4110A-ms98-a,32,A,229.798125,239.91875,10.120625,uh-huh well i know when the leaves change there too would be a pretty time except you can't really depend on your weather ,1,0
sw4110A-ms98-a,36,A,249.656625,261.389125,11.7325,and the first year we came up there the leaves were changing and since then we've been coming about a week or so too early  but uh i would think that that would be a really nice place for camping,1,0
sw4110B-ms98-a,60,B,288.234,289.820875,1.586875,that'd be nice,1,0
sw4111A-ms98-a,2,A,6.502,16.151,9.649,it's just coincidental that that's the way it is but my feelings happen to be that i'm against capital punishment uh and,1,0
sw4111A-ms98-a,11,A,79.96975,93.46025,13.4905,penal people's rights and i don't think they have the right to take away a life no i think definitely there should be uh severe punishment uh to deter other people from,1,0
sw4111A-ms98-a,12,A,93.46025,102.345625,8.885375,doing such heinous crimes uh for instance i think life imprisonment should be necessary for anybody who commits any murder of any sort,1,0
sw4111A-ms98-a,13,A,102.345625,113.787375,11.44175,and i also think that uh other things that are currently not legal in the country should be made legal such as putting prisoners to work and making them earn their their pay,1,0
sw4111A-ms98-a,15,A,118.125,129.47075,11.34575,to uh people that perform crimes i think also people that are prone to commit a murder are not going to be deterred by the thought of being put to death i think that if they're,1,0
sw4111A-ms98-a,18,A,161.234875,167.443125,6.20825,yeah and i think that's unfortunate that is probably the way it is today and i think that ought to be changed uh,1,0
sw4111A-ms98-a,19,A,167.443125,179.294375,11.85125,i think like i said i think people ought to be made to pay for their stay and not make it pleasant for them i think hard labor should be required even among people that a- a- are not able,2,0
sw4111A-ms98-a,20,A,179.294375,190.292,10.997625,to perform hard labor you know if th- if they died naturally from working then i guess that would be okay because that wouldn't be uh putting anybody to death forcibly,2,0
sw4111A-ms98-a,23,A,207.084625,210.991625,3.907,in California i i thought there was but i could be wrong,1,0
sw4111A-ms98-a,25,A,216.867875,228.30325,11.435375,people really want to see it uh be put into effect it seems more so than those of us who feel the way i feel uh uh at least are vocal,1,0
sw4111B-ms98-a,7,B,67.968625,72.985875,5.01725,does he really have the right to  continue living and be a burden on society,1,0
sw4112A-ms98-a,44,A,138.553375,141.859,3.305625,that would be a wonderful idea,1,0
sw4112A-ms98-a,88,A,264.037625,269.583875,5.54625,i'm going to be doing research for a professor next quarter and see how i like that see uh,1,0
sw4112A-ms98-a,89,A,269.583875,273.553625,3.96975,if research for a school would be something i would consider,1,0
sw4112B-ms98-a,15,B,59.9795,69.84625,9.86675,but i don't know i think that it would be great if instead of having health insurance and all those things tied to a job the way they are now,1,0
sw4112B-ms98-a,16,B,69.84625,80.10175,10.2555,so that some people can get them and some people can't and it's like having two classes of income some that is taxed and some that is not it'd be great if they had,1,0
sw4112B-ms98-a,19,B,86.888375,93.3095,6.421125,they could be responsible for their own health insurance but if they did take the company benefit then that would be taxed like other income,2,0
sw4112B-ms98-a,33,B,156.398375,164.2925,7.894125,you know benefits i don't know how important that'll be usually academic jobs you get TIAA for your retirement plan,1,0
sw4112B-ms98-a,37,B,176.05175,186.172125,10.120375,a lot of an academic jobs give you that but on the other hand state retirement if you work for a state university can be very secure in taking  good care of you,1,0
sw4112B-ms98-a,44,B,231.50825,241.44775,9.9395,so and that's the lowest it's been in quite some time and so health insurance can be a real big important thing to get,1,0
sw4113A-ms98-a,26,A,83.412375,89.8875,6.475125,and that you know you can't just send someone off to Washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective,1,0
sw4113B-ms98-a,5,B,26.774125,37.90275,11.128625,i think by putting term limitations on you could you could slow down some of the problems uh but it has to be not just at the national level but at the you know the state and the local level too,1,0
sw4113B-ms98-a,8,B,55.534125,65.101125,9.567,which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and you know i'm going like i i don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than i am and they work less,1,0
sw4113B-ms98-a,12,B,104.66475,110.882125,6.217375,i mean that's true of the presidency too and we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover every eight years or four years ,1,0
sw4113B-ms98-a,14,B,119.807375,132.233625,12.42625,i think it has to be extended uh you know a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms or you would increase the length of the of each term of a Congressman,2,0
sw4113B-ms98-a,20,B,224.040625,237.768625,13.728,the C I A is a a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia yeah you know it might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive,1,0
sw4114A-ms98-a,15,A,40.8,53.686625,12.886625,well i don't know about you but i've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor i mean there's a lot of contributors but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that,1,0
sw4114B-ms98-a,46,B,288.80125,294.573125,5.771875,yeah there it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of uh heavy industry you know that would be causing it ,1,0
sw4115B-ms98-a,17,B,69.850125,77.117125,7.267,as far as our taxes and all the all the hidden costs that they spend our money on that that they shouldn't be spending our money on,1,0
sw4116A-ms98-a,4,A,21.4955,34.12625,12.63075,we're gonna test you you know periodically or something like this because the job is of the security nature or for the you know and the public safety or something that's might be one thing but i really believe that the employee,1,0
sw4117A-ms98-a,4,A,28.804125,36.384,7.579875,very long period of time or if they're really you know mentally ill then i don't think they can really be held accountable for their actions anyway,1,0
sw4117A-ms98-a,19,A,184.639875,194.646875,10.007,and then i think well i wouldn't you know you you don't want to be cruel to these guys and they say by throwing them_1 in a jail where they're you know they're constantly abused or what other other brother or uh o- other cell mates you know,1,0
sw4117A-ms98-a,29,A,262.328125,269.817,7.488875,some guy is you know off there in the wilderness or something you know  and and and he just doesn't wanna be part of society,1,0
sw4117A-ms98-a,32,A,288.44475,298.946,10.50125,you know that i can ima- million scenarios that i can imagine where the guy would be sort of like hey i don't wanna be in this society you know leave me alone you know and he'd fight back and if he killed somebody you know he'd get the death penalty you know,2,0
sw4117B-ms98-a,7,B,47.64225,58.2785,10.63625, that's probably a pretty good objection um yeah actually i'm i'm in favor of it um  this ought to be an interesting discussion uh  um,1,0
sw4118A-ms98-a,23,A,155.479,168.50175,13.02275,let's see he made he made a lot of money working be- because like in in the states like Massachusetts and Vermont and all the states around New Hampshire they put in this bottle bill do you have a bottle bill down there,1,0
sw4118A-ms98-a,33,A,216.32775,222.672625,6.344875,they they could make money on because aluminum can be they can just throw that back into the pot,1,0
sw4118A-ms98-a,35,A,228.991875,241.637375,12.6455,they they lost like big money on because they can't rec- they can't reuse the some plastics can be reused but most plastics can't be  remolded or mel- melted into into other things,2,0
sw4118A-ms98-a,38,A,248.87125,252.81325,3.942,should they be making things that like just can't be reused,2,0
sw4118A-ms98-a,41,A,257.41425,260.573625,3.159375,should i be buying things that can't be reused,2,0
sw4118A-ms98-a,47,A,289.069625,292.488,3.418375,at at what point in time did it get to be,1,0
sw4118A-ms98-a,48,A,292.488,298.562,6.074,at what you know i didn't i thought they were great but at what point in time did it get to be worse,1,0
sw4119A-ms98-a,9,A,101.170375,113.474,12.303625,but i would think that it also acts as a deterrent if someone if someone knows that there's a threat that that they might get caught it might be that much more of an impetus to to stay away from from whatever the drug is they're they're on,1,0
sw4119A-ms98-a,12,A,131.838375,145.1745,13.336125,that tha- that would act to discourage them that it would um you know if you know dad's in the other room perhaps you're going to be less likely to steal the the cookies out of the cookie jar because_1 he might be coming in any minute you know,2,0
sw4119A-ms98-a,17,A,207.854875,220.8265,12.971625,taking the money taking all the money that he gets for uh uh fighting the war on drugs and use it for like drug education to to open up the methadone programs to get the people off drugs that that wanna be off drugs um,1,0
sw4119A-ms98-a,19,A,232.692375,243.551375,10.859,um would be a better idea but and and i agreed with him somewhat i could see his point but uh Switzerland opened up a um uh a park ,1,0
sw4119B-ms98-a,6,B,49.819625,62.29225,12.472625,you know we'd lose the whole morning what is that that's a thousand man hours uh to go go through this and in the end they would just be shooting for trying to catch a few specific people it really aggravated me,1,0
sw4119B-ms98-a,8,B,75.260125,85.870875,10.61075,um concern over somebody being under the influence while they're at work but they could easily be under the influence of alcohol or any number of other things as well,1,0
sw4119B-ms98-a,15,B,181.296,193.555375,12.259375,you know the the high profit margin i don't think it would be going on i don't think that uh we'd have the crime over there that we do and man it really spills over into the neighborhood here as well there's at least one nasty bloody,1,0
sw4120A-ms98-a,23,A,155.662625,166.724375,11.06175,uh this requires a very strong minded management and uh uh a supervisory it requires the supervisor to be brass balled i- in a sense,1,0
sw4120A-ms98-a,24,A,166.724375,176.0045,9.280125,to go to a an employee who appears to possibly be under the influence of drugs and say  you've got to take a drug test,1,0
sw4120B-ms98-a,22,B,121.273,127.400875,6.127875,oh yeah you know i might i might see a case as well where it might be warranted in um,1,0
sw4120B-ms98-a,33,B,203.391875,216.813625,13.42175,any any problems that uh anyone knows about if you know what i mean there may be problems but no one is aware of them so it it's sort of a an invisible thing for us um ,1,0
sw4120B-ms98-a,37,B,242.7735,249.7645,6.991,uh random i- if it were gonna be done random would be the only way to do it otherwise you're unfairly singling someone out,2,0
sw4120B-ms98-a,41,B,285.3705,287.383625,2.013125,oh sure you have to be sharp,1,0
sw4121A-ms98-a,48,A,268.385,279.455,11.07,um but i just thought you know we had thought wow this would be a nice little sideline because there's ev- we'd been going out to the bars around here and we'd asked at three different places and nobody recycles,1,0
sw4121B-ms98-a,19,B,105.002375,118.926875,13.9245,it was really a lot hard harder to do it because_1 um it's different depending on what town you're in basically every town is different which i think that that's crazy that it should be coordinated by the state or something but,1,0
sw4122A-ms98-a,34,A,101.95175,110.009,8.05725, that's just what you want to hear about uh people who are individually insured you know once you get sick you can be booted right out ,1,0
sw4122B-ms98-a,17,B,58.002625,62.500625,4.498,no that's just me but they can be i have that option but it's more money,1,0
sw4122B-ms98-a,74,B,241.371125,246.98175,5.610625,but they do give you a certain amount of time to be home and get adjusted i guess,1,0
sw4123A-ms98-a,6,A,26.8575,34.56625,7.70875,oh okay well i would probably be a junkie or s- watch CNN a lot but i don't uh,1,0
sw4123A-ms98-a,7,A,34.56625,41.506625,6.940375, i don't uh subscribe to cable be- because of the poor service and also uh,1,0
sw4123B-ms98-a,34,B,174.8545,182.24625,7.39175,their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than say your major network news and that kind of thing,1,0
sw4123B-ms98-a,54,B,261.116125,274.797375,13.68125,if you watch the news you're going your opinion is going to be formed about on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own -pinion opinion which i haven't would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's,2,0
sw4124A-ms98-a,5,A,42.449375,52.400875,9.9515,has become as much of an issue as it has because you know we know these things are designed to be closed systems either whether the problem's due to leaks or due to failures i would think that um,1,0
sw4124A-ms98-a,13,A,97.00925,104.06075,7.0515,so what what do you what do you see as the other biggies being in that realm you know what else could be something that is a bad thing,1,0
sw4125A-ms98-a,26,A,142.875,145.943,3.068,do you think that's appropriate or should it be changed,1,0
sw4125A-ms98-a,30,A,195.05775,204.36125,9.3035,and also what they can be told about the effects of sentencing Like if you give somebody fifteen years they'll be out in three weeks or something like that,2,0
sw4125B-ms98-a,14,B,50.326625,59.45675,9.130125,i don't know i i've always thought that the f- th- the fact that it has to be unanimous means that there wasn't any doubt in people's minds,1,0
sw4125B-ms98-a,19,B,79.023,89.771,10.748,um you know i don't i think one one change that might be worthwhile would be to say that you need unanimous verdict to find somebody guilty,2,0
sw4125B-ms98-a,35,B,163.045125,172.0145,8.969375,i- i think that by the time you get to that point all the facts have been settled the person's been convicted and the punishment should be,1,0
sw4125B-ms98-a,36,B,172.0145,184.121375,12.106875,well a fairly objective uh thing uh i don't know if there really needs to be all that much discretion in sentencing once you've determined what crime the person is guilty of,1,0
sw4125B-ms98-a,40,B,210.385,224.5715,14.1865,yeah here in Georgia when they have the jury involved in sentencing like in a capital case the prosecution is not allowed to say that if you if you give them life he'll be out in seven years that's against the rules,1,0
sw4125B-ms98-a,43,B,237.200875,246.415875,9.215,uh and uh obviously the judge knows what all the guidelines uh or what all the effects can be of parole and things like that,1,0
sw4125B-ms98-a,46,B,255.28475,266.160125,10.875375,is for juries to be required to be informed of their right to judge not only the facts of the case but also the law itself,2,0
sw4126A-ms98-a,39,A,118.472375,128.313875,9.8415,yeah that's the problem with with that is like if you wanna be consistent and then the weather's bad you can't really or get out when it's cold or whatever,1,0
sw4126A-ms98-a,71,A,229.023875,230.999125,1.97525,yeah that would be tough,1,0
sw4126B-ms98-a,76,B,257.974375,261.26075,3.286375,i hear they're supposed to be pretty good huh ,1,0
sw4128A-ms98-a,17,A,171.188875,174.47825,3.289375,you'll probably be weeded out huh ,1,0
sw4128B-ms98-a,12,B,55.996,70.003,14.007,are overstepping their bounds and they shouldn't be the the juries should be the only ones that uh have a say in it and other times i think well no the juries are out of hand the judges need to step in,2,0
sw4128B-ms98-a,16,B,111.4955,122.495625,11.000125,uh how should i say it they agreed that the one person was guilty and they and they agreed that the fine should be so much and then the judge came along and set aside the judgement which,1,0
sw4128B-ms98-a,20,B,143.843,153.729,9.886,uh to be the lowest uh how should i say this they have any opinions at all they're weeded out been one or the other of the uh of the lawyers,1,0
sw4128B-ms98-a,23,B,156.51875,159.4835,2.96475,to be honest with you i've i've uh,1,0
sw4128B-ms98-a,25,B,160.489875,165.655,5.165125,i don't think that's right and if i ever am called to be a a juror,1,0
sw4128B-ms98-a,29,B,172.495875,184.22025,11.724375,well i- i i if i answer honestly if i answer honestly i'll be weeded out if i if i just like looked at him and say uh no i don't have strong opinions because i feel like you know i want to be part of the process,2,0
sw4128B-ms98-a,39,B,228.497875,242.987,14.489125,no well what i'm trying to say is the jury jurors are selected to basically be from what i've been told milk toasts if they have any opinions if they could understand anything an engineer could never be uh a juror for instance because he's,2,0
sw4128B-ms98-a,44,B,272.971625,281.034875,8.06325,right uh that's what you want but on the other hand if the lawyer thinks no i don't want a bunch of people in here who are going to be able to weed their way through,1,0
sw4128B-ms98-a,46,B,291.983,298.402,6.419,trying not to be prejudiced against them but you know any any education will disqualify you in in many cases i've been,1,0
sw4129A-ms98-a,14,A,69.241875,71.884,2.642125,right that would be the intent of it,1,0
sw4129A-ms98-a,16,A,74.996875,78.9705,3.973625,well i think it would be more successful if it was applied,1,0
sw4129A-ms98-a,17,A,78.9705,89.484625,10.514125,in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many appeals yeah if if the person who's gonna commit the crime knew that they were gonna be punished severely possibly capital punishment,1,0
sw4129B-ms98-a,13,B,60.994625,63.89525,2.900625,well i think capital punishment is supposed to be,1,0
sw4129B-ms98-a,30,B,105.76825,111.458625,5.690375,and i see kids already that are gonna be criminals,1,0
sw4129B-ms98-a,43,B,146.238625,150.560125,4.3215,i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes,1,0
sw4129B-ms98-a,54,B,186.95375,192.91375,5.96,and that kind of thing and if we had something to do before they get to be full blown adult criminals,1,0
sw4129B-ms98-a,56,B,193.957375,200.3815,6.424125,and i'm not talking about_1 necessarily in the school system i'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action,1,0
sw4129B-ms98-a,66,B,229.0555,233.2265,4.171,if you could find a way to prevent some of it and i'm not sure what it would be,1,0
sw4129B-ms98-a,68,B,234.234875,236.364875,2.13,it would be money better spent,1,0
sw4130A-ms98-a,10,A,42.847,54.282125,11.435125,and if you are not only will they not give you um a policy but they'll um they have like there's like you know a database of people that have tested positive so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again,1,0
sw4130A-ms98-a,23,A,88.47075,98.656,10.18525,yeah one one one hu- one humorous retort i heard heard someone you know who claimed that you know AIDS was you know God's punishment was that then lesbians must be God's chosen people,1,0
sw4130B-ms98-a,37,B,160.038625,170.227125,10.1885,i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominated so far because it's you know it's bound to spread ,1,0
sw4130B-ms98-a,43,B,196.481625,201.682875,5.20125,move our our political system sort of see- seems to be taking,1,0
sw4130B-ms98-a,53,B,252.360875,260.17725,7.816375,and uh uh uh i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand,1,0
sw4130B-ms98-a,54,B,260.17725,269.19075,9.0135,you know try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not you know they don't they don't have to be just completely ,1,0
sw4131A-ms98-a,3,A,9.12,18.54875,9.42875,i'm thinking that it would also be nice to have kind of a a nicer bigger maybe more luxu- luxurious car to have in addition to the one i already have,1,0
sw4131A-ms98-a,7,A,40.889125,50.76475,9.875625,uh other people that owned turbo charge cars that the turbo would break quite often be very expensive to fix but i haven't had any problems with it,1,0
sw4131A-ms98-a,27,A,132.01775,139.1395,7.12175,it would be nice to have something where something roomier where people didn't have to duck their heads or scrunch their knees up and,1,0
sw4131A-ms98-a,35,A,165.21025,173.86275,8.6525,i don't know when you're when you're used to one thing i guess something different always seems like it would be fun to have or nice to have,1,0
sw4132A-ms98-a,10,A,58.34925,62.257875,3.908625,and uh in fact come think of it we did the outside the trim of the house and that turned out to be  quite a job  since we have a two story house   ,1,0
sw4132A-ms98-a,14,A,75.6645,82.676375,7.011875,but that was a  that turned out to be quite a job too it was a game room and uh,1,0
sw4132A-ms98-a,26,A,163.820125,167.517125,3.697,decided that was gonna be a bit much and uh,1,0
sw4132A-ms98-a,28,A,179.013625,184.597125,5.5835,and that turned out to be quite a project uh ,1,0
sw4132A-ms98-a,38,A,232.060125,243.073,11.012875,we figure some of the burners or heated elements are going out  and we priced them and kind of felt like it be just as cheap for us to go on and change it out and,1,0
sw4132A-ms98-a,39,A,243.073,251.04075,7.96775, and be done with it  than this waiting for it to flood us and like it did before,1,0
sw4132B-ms98-a,18,B,100.31925,113.146125,12.826875,and uh it's amazing how these things work one of my most um am- amazing things is to me is that what appears to be the major part of the work basically putting the structure up happens very quickly,1,0
sw4133A-ms98-a,7,A,26.984125,31.35,4.365875,um and you know it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent,1,0
sw4133A-ms98-a,8,A,31.35,42.4995,11.1495,um for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly don't think the people that are committing the c- crimes that would be eligible you know really care,1,0
sw4133A-ms98-a,24,A,111.994875,124.354625,12.35975, you you can apologize nicely but you know you know i think you know the the price you know it i've heard quotes you know it's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned,1,0
sw4133A-ms98-a,28,A,139.0755,151.499125,12.423625,the i i think that you know and the way it's being used now it's like you listen to Bush's you know well where are we gonna impose dr- you know it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in Tsongas is also saying you know capital make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer,1,0
sw4133A-ms98-a,42,A,209.14225,213.5085,4.36625,you know your a a  a sixty two year old guy is less likely to be,1,0
sw4133A-ms98-a,48,A,245.18625,250.139375,4.953125,you know th- you know what the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society,2,0
sw4133A-ms98-a,54,A,270.815,283.118125,12.303125,and what if it just turned out to be genetic or biochemical in origin so if someday we can go to Jeff Dahmer and say well the problem is you you've got an endorphin imbalance and you know if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society,2,0
sw4134A-ms98-a,6,A,30.489375,37.496125,7.00675,i don't know there's really very little depth to it they seem to be really out to try and entertain more than uh,1,0
sw4134A-ms98-a,35,A,254.491375,263.477375,8.986,yeah me too i really if if i when i move when i go to my next job i'm really going to be uh upset if i don't have access to that,1,0
sw4134A-ms98-a,42,A,294.01175,298.402,4.39025,excellent yeah that really seems to be a a one of the cutting leading,1,0
sw4134B-ms98-a,15,B,130.018125,139.021375,9.00325,we're going to be fair so we're going to present two highly polarized articles which which is uh better than than one but uh,1,0
sw4135A-ms98-a,35,A,210.339,220.9985,10.6595,it was really you know that was really good and helpful and it you know it had them you know supp- if they could support opp- oppose or or you know be undecided about it,1,0
sw4136B-ms98-a,9,B,40.477125,52.685375,12.20825,get interested in a news article so i guess a little bit leaks through there and uh sometimes on a on a plane or in a airport i'll i'll be sitting some somewhere and there will be a newspaper next to me and i'll read parts of it,2,0
sw4137A-ms98-a,5,A,16.652,22.281375,5.629375,no regardless of that fact it's the best car in the class for the be- cheapest amount of money,1,0
sw4137A-ms98-a,12,A,54.215875,67.00125,12.785375,and it just you know it it dominated over all of them everybody all the uh raters loved it i like the i like the styling and i seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it,1,0
sw4137A-ms98-a,23,A,92.499125,101.083875,8.58475,that it's fast but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing but it's it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the go Saturn,1,0
sw4138B-ms98-a,14,B,178.20575,184.65575,6.45,it should be i think a flat percentage and uh that percentage ought to be an equitable amount,2,0
sw4138B-ms98-a,18,B,204.279,210.71575,6.43675,and i totaled them all up and basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax,1,0
sw4139B-ms98-a,15,B,56.49575,64.80225,8.3065,well we don't have uh well let's see i guess it might be available i just haven't heard of it on that one i i guess i have come to think of it but uh,1,0
sw4139B-ms98-a,42,B,154.153125,158.9875,4.834375,gets there laying around and don't get to read it's does get to be quite a volume of,1,0
sw4140A-ms98-a,9,A,118.477375,130.79775,12.320375,well that's a that's a  that's a good point also we have to we have to be c- cognizant that our society's becoming more and more haves and have nots ,1,0
sw4140A-ms98-a,13,A,192.498625,199.811875,7.31325,peoples and societies and cultures and things that are be o- that are oppressed and so that to,1,0
sw4140B-ms98-a,3,B,47.69575,57.79575,10.1,should be restricted because of their extreme potential to uh  uh to produce collateral damage if you know what i mean,1,0
sw4140B-ms98-a,5,B,67.14825,73.37475,6.2265,in that i think that any any arm that can easily be carried by hand,1,0
sw4140B-ms98-a,6,B,73.37475,86.601875,13.227125,should certainly be uh protected for individuals to own and uh to use uh in particular i'll express my opinion on this uh this there's there's some people that think that,1,0
sw4140B-ms98-a,9,B,107.975625,118.73425,10.758625,or target shooting what they had in mind was that people need to be armed in order to protect themselves from the government becoming too strong and taking away our liberties,1,0
sw4140B-ms98-a,17,B,221.571375,233.448125,11.87675,what the electorate seems to be telling them the problem is of course is that the majority of the people in this country have no idea what the right to keep and bear arms means or what it's for,1,0
sw4141A-ms98-a,13,A,51.994375,64.969125,12.97475,well it was very it was interesting because it it's just you know part of their makeup they're psyche i mean they just hate each other automatically but after a while they they got to be good friends and uh,1,0
sw4141B-ms98-a,22,B,83.1945,95.02325,11.82875,uh you know you tend to personify these things but our our cat thinks our oldest cat thinks that it it should be a person and our youngest cat actually thinks it's a cat,1,0
sw4142A-ms98-a,12,A,51.967,64.000375,12.033375,right i don't have any problem at all with income tax some of the property taxes are well i don't know if they're unfair they're confusing and i there seems to be,1,0
sw4142B-ms98-a,9,B,45.807125,51.98225,6.175125,generally i think they're pretty necessary and life would probably be a lot worse if they didn't have taxation ,1,0
sw4142B-ms98-a,20,B,132.402375,140.63275,8.230375,uh they didn't raise my neighbors'  they actually reduced mine to be in line with uh a more reasonable appraisal,1,0
sw4142B-ms98-a,34,B,233.389,242.81275,9.42375,uh one of the guys is actually a kind of a well known realtor around here  you know i I figured if anybody gave me a hard time it'd be him ,1,0
sw4143B-ms98-a,40,B,263.51425,270.5695,7.05525,so many towns and cities have started recycling with there might not be enough firms out there,1,0
sw4144B-ms98-a,48,B,214.6285,216.79425,2.16575,needs to be cut out,1,0
sw4144B-ms98-a,54,B,230.484625,232.6155,2.130875,there's got to be some sort of cheap,1,0
sw4145A-ms98-a,89,A,290.358375,299.554,9.195625,and uh i there's a lot of complications that go along with saying that but i- just nothing else seems to be working,1,0
sw4145B-ms98-a,7,B,32.797875,42.677,9.879125,oh i don't think anything is going to be uh is foolproof i think it's it's a deterrent i think if they have a choice between our place and one house that's not protected they'll go to the other place,1,0
sw4145B-ms98-a,34,B,202.47125,215.245625,12.774375,there's so many other problems to go around and economy's a problem and i guess at one time Russia was a problem and uh every there there's always one problem or another seems to be uh ahead of the crime problem but uh,1,0
sw4145B-ms98-a,35,B,215.245625,218.880375,3.63475,that's probably that has to be one of the top two or three,1,0
sw4145B-ms98-a,39,B,226.347,234.927625,8.580625,yeah you know i think we think we're real sophisticated we're really not when you come right down to it there used to be a lot of stuff on the highways and the roads when you're driving around dropped by people that are,1,0
sw4146A-ms98-a,9,A,89.24275,103.58925,14.3465,often a judge uh and and you hope you get one that's that's really rational and and looks at uh each case separately you'd like to be able to give them some flexibility to be able to sentence,2,0
sw4146A-ms98-a,12,A,119.003625,133.04425,14.040625,that you'd like be able to see them give a different kind of punishment uh not necessary community service that's getting a little bit overworked but but but rather some of other sort of of restitution rather than simply putting them_1 away behind bars,1,0
sw4146A-ms98-a,23,A,236.827625,248.578875,11.75125,uh and the uh uh the attorney asked my mother well uh how do you feel about this and she told him quite frankly that she thought that the punishment should be extremely severe for rapist and then,1,0
sw4146A-ms98-a,28,A,284.491375,298.85,14.358625,my mother's fairly well read she didn't actually know about this local case it was of rather small import uh but i would agree with you that that not necessarily does somebody have to be ignorant not to know but they'd have to have met,1,0
sw4146B-ms98-a,5,B,34.27725,40.345375,6.068125,think that that i- i would not be totally adverse to the concept of of uh,1,0
sw4146B-ms98-a,18,B,184.719375,195.513375,10.794,now i- i i'm not so sure that would be true if it were a trial of uh of uh some notor- no- no- notoriety,1,0
sw4146B-ms98-a,19,B,195.513375,208.995125,13.48175,uh but in the case of the normal trials it's much much harder than it used to be t- than to get out of it so they do try not to let uh excuses get you out of uh trials now,1,0
sw4147B-ms98-a,25,B,134.376125,143.749125,9.373,it was an age where it was uh we thought it would be good for them to have the discipline that goes with with having a pet uh,1,0
sw4147B-ms98-a,47,B,255.549375,260.820625,5.27125,uh there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal but the same time,1,0
sw4148A-ms98-a,4,A,4.72275,16.60225,11.8795,with the issue of trial by jury um i actually found the whole question about whether you need a a unan- a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting ,1,0
sw4148A-ms98-a,10,A,70.42275,77.29575,6.873,well i'd be curious as to what the um requirement for a an acquittal is ,1,0
sw4148A-ms98-a,11,A,77.29575,91.863375,14.567625,i mean i- i don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if you know six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal ,1,0
sw4148B-ms98-a,5,B,43.75875,53.1795,9.42075,yeah i actually thought i'd read that too and that's why i phrased it that way i wonder the difference yeah the difference could be that for um state ,1,0
sw4148B-ms98-a,7,B,64.01525,71.041125,7.025875,but i don't know what the the laws do you think that that's an unreasonable um requirement that they be unanimous ,1,0
sw4148B-ms98-a,9,B,97.78275,109.541375,11.758625,yeah that that would be an interesting change it would also allow i- the um idea that if you had one person who was um very disagreeable ,1,0
sw4148B-ms98-a,12,B,127.410375,136.589125,9.17875,increases the the likelihood of getting the proper judgment so i i think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision ,1,0
sw4148B-ms98-a,14,B,144.153,158.094,13.941,yeah actually i- i thought that that would be very interesting thing to do i would like to do that i've been out here twenty some years and i've been called um three different times but i've never actually even made it into the the jury box ,1,0
sw4148B-ms98-a,16,B,164.3785,168.500625,4.122125,um i yeah i also think that would be really good uh ,1,0
sw4148B-ms98-a,22,B,215.223375,229.832,14.608625,going on and that that um peer pressure and in some cases if it's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons ,1,0
sw4149A-ms98-a,1,A,0,10.855875,10.855875, Wendy i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if uh if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh,1,0
sw4149A-ms98-a,17,A,113.77475,127.0365,13.26175,we've uh  we've been married for about ten years and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh,1,0
sw4149B-ms98-a,29,B,164.37125,168.843375,4.472125, with two kids that could be hard,1,0
sw4150B-ms98-a,5,B,9.899875,23.5485,13.648625,so this is a big issue with us although i don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about but  perhaps they are looking for uh words to be said like day care and quality time and,1,0
sw4150B-ms98-a,10,B,32.452375,45.392625,12.94025,you know i know we're not supposed to do this long distance but actually i'm getting a call i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting could i ask you to hold one minute i'll be right back excuse me just a moment they're gonna get mad ,1,0
sw4150B-ms98-a,16,B,69.488875,78.412125,8.92325,well i don't wanna i don't want this to be a   but  yes we do both my husband and i work and our children are sixth fourth and third grade,1,0
sw4150B-ms98-a,36,B,176.1265,188.456375,12.329875,and i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing and i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home i really believe that,1,0
sw4150B-ms98-a,39,B,197.66775,207.3275,9.65975,and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot so i know it sounds like a rationalization but it's,1,0
sw4150B-ms98-a,44,B,228.11975,235.559125,7.439375,been real fulfilled i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child it's a wonderful it's wonderful to be a mother but,1,0
sw4150B-ms98-a,50,B,270.2305,277.0605,6.83,and they learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they're secure  i think that helps,2,0
sw4151A-ms98-a,9,A,78.48925,84.651625,6.162375,uh situation he would be he would hope that there would be people around him who would uh,2,0
sw4151A-ms98-a,18,A,164.440625,175.14775,10.707125,see i don't think a decision's ever gonna be made on dea- on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who,1,0
sw4151A-ms98-a,29,A,260.980625,267.376625,6.396,if we really wa- if it was really seriously gonna be a de- deterrent i would think that it would be public i mean i don't think it would be,3,0
sw4151A-ms98-a,30,A,267.376625,275.913,8.536375,this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever sees it if someone ever if you know like say some young kids or something like that that that might be inclined more towards the life of crime,1,0
sw4151B-ms98-a,3,B,9.031625,16.031125,6.9995,that's a good question uh  there would be a point there was a point where i would have said,1,0
sw4151B-ms98-a,11,B,45.629625,49.929625,4.3,try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment,1,0
sw4151B-ms98-a,19,B,131.909375,142.0915,10.182125,uh you know whether it be a biblical force uh you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic,1,0
sw4152A-ms98-a,17,A,81.3795,90.091375,8.711875,so you know and i- i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on,2,0
sw4152B-ms98-a,31,B,173.169,178.336125,5.167125,oh my goodness that can't be good for Los Angeles either,1,0
sw4152B-ms98-a,41,B,208.997625,215.641875,6.64425,what about the judge who's hearing the case is he gonna be impartial is he going to be a g- a good adjudicator,2,0
sw4153A-ms98-a,2,A,9.64875,22.6835,13.03475,they can be deceiving to people i did not work there long because i couldn't handle the the treatment that the children got and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three um centers,2,0
sw4153A-ms98-a,3,A,22.6835,30.655625,7.972125,all over you know the um city and they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left,2,0
sw4153A-ms98-a,54,A,277.00425,279.990625,2.986375,yeah that has to be with a day care center,1,0
sw4153B-ms98-a,42,B,149.32325,155.81375,6.4905,it sounds like to me your  your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people,1,0
sw4154A-ms98-a,40,A,123.226875,125.695875,2.469,public statements can be taken for,1,0
sw4154B-ms98-a,14,B,58.493,66.235625,7.742625,well i we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves you know we s- kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet,1,0
sw4154B-ms98-a,17,B,82.176125,96.03825,13.862125,uh launched there that just seemed to me to be a uh a phenomenal uh demonstration of restraint and it must have reflected uh uh some awful good uh diplomacy on the part of the US,1,0
sw4156B-ms98-a,11,B,32.49775,42.996,10.49825,and then i also have files for like credit card receipts and when the bills come in for the credit cards they go in the month that they have to be paid for,1,0
sw4156B-ms98-a,14,B,48.81325,62.25275,13.4395,unless i get paid on time like like for instance if a bill is due on March fourth i'll just i'll put it in the folder with March and that way when i get paid in March i know that whatever bill is in there have to be paid in that month,1,0
sw4156B-ms98-a,38,B,167.767625,182.504375,14.73675,right whenever my tags come up uh there is an entry right there that says tags and then i just leave the space blank until i find out how much i owe for my tags and then i get them_1 and that way i know i know that they have to be paid in that month so i'm expecting it,1,0
sw4157A-ms98-a,31,A,149.826375,158.731375,8.905,you know i'm real  you  it's like well you know you know there's got to be better ways you know to do some things but you know i hate to ,1,0
sw4157A-ms98-a,34,A,170.72675,177.73425,7.0075,they have to compete to be to be good and to be knowledgeable but at the same time there's a,3,0
sw4157A-ms98-a,37,A,199.983125,213.23075,13.247625,you know they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item and that's ridiculous and i don't think that is that is um abnormal in any means to be doing things like that and,1,0
sw4157A-ms98-a,38,A,213.23075,217.2615,4.03075,i don't think that is that is uh abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all,1,0
sw4157B-ms98-a,6,B,29.466875,42.971,13.504125,um the bad was more apparent i think at least for me because i think it affected people's lives on in a way that you could see one one thing that i noticed is it's very very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden,1,0
sw4157B-ms98-a,7,B,42.971,48.77175,5.80075,because it's treated as a disease now i don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine but,1,0
sw4157B-ms98-a,10,B,67.999375,79.030375,11.031,i remember this one row of houses and they were uh row houses or townhouses all connected together so it was like lower middle-class housing well it'd be lower middle-class housing here it's probably,1,0
sw4157B-ms98-a,13,B,93.032125,100.674,7.641875,whereas here there's a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward and that that didn't exist in Sweden,1,0
sw4158A-ms98-a,38,A,160.848,166.7675,5.9195,part of it there because_1 that that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems my dad i think my i'm still covered on,1,0
sw4158A-ms98-a,40,A,170.685625,174.163625,3.478,it definitely be something to look into i guess once i get my own ,1,0
sw4158B-ms98-a,16,B,85.024125,95.26725,10.243125,and they pay for you know pay for the classes so for Carnegie Mellon that works out to be um a reasonable a reasonable benefit,1,0
sw4158B-ms98-a,53,B,240.047625,250.443125,10.3955,um income caps on Social Security to the point  you have to be pretty you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying,2,0
sw4159B-ms98-a,10,B,48.433625,56.3055,7.871875,the going you know if you will the going uh award should be for a certain type of case you know within some kind of range,1,0
sw4159B-ms98-a,15,B,82.24475,87.137375,4.892625,and uh granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged,1,0
sw4159B-ms98-a,23,B,142.717625,149.751125,7.0335,i- i think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there and that may be where the judiciary is a little more,2,0
sw4159B-ms98-a,24,B,149.751125,163.4355,13.684375,learned about that s- type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing and it could be part of continuing education maybe for judges  i don't know you know to get into the economics of things uh,2,0
sw4159B-ms98-a,27,B,184.444875,190.632375,6.1875,which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages i think those should be uninsurable,1,0
sw4159B-ms98-a,28,B,190.632375,196.948625,6.31625,i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that that did the damage,1,0
sw4159B-ms98-a,39,B,264.705875,271.76525,7.059375,and unfortunately the j- the lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too,1,0
sw4160A-ms98-a,26,A,209.210875,214.536125,5.32525, with the desperate fear that by the time they are old enough to use it it's not going to be enough anyway,1,0
sw4160B-ms98-a,14,B,82.49575,93.185125,10.689375,how our expenses compare to my income and make sure that we're not getting a beyond uh what we should be spending in any particular area,1,0
sw4160B-ms98-a,15,B,93.185125,104.968875,11.78375,and try and figure out for the for the year whether we're going to be able to to cover the unusual expenses such as property taxes and others things that come up from time to time,1,0
sw4160B-ms98-a,53,B,271.014,279.477875,8.463875,and then hoping the hoping if i get a few raises that i'll  be able to get beyond that but right now that's all i'm able to save,1,0
sw4161B-ms98-a,57,B,294.012875,298.946,4.933125,that life would be a little easier around our house even yet if i had her do do that because,1,0
sw4162A-ms98-a,17,A,71.555,74.4345,2.8795,that would be a good a good resource to check,1,0
sw4162A-ms98-a,28,A,107.450125,116.466375,9.01625,right because then there's some places and i w- and i would don't this would be a a big minus for the places there are some places that state that you cannot come in unannounced,1,0
sw4162A-ms98-a,35,A,135.7335,148.01475,12.28125,and i think you've also got to loo- you know whenever you go in and you know talk to the talk to the the the teachers and look at the toys that they have and the environment that the kids'll be in,1,0
sw4162A-ms98-a,70,A,279.774625,283.514375,3.73975,so one thing i would look at would be um,1,0
sw4162B-ms98-a,9,B,29.750125,36.071625,6.3215,um probably number one too would be close references,1,0
sw4162B-ms98-a,11,B,42.412,44.982375,2.570375,would be very important,1,0
sw4163A-ms98-a,2,A,0.339,6.846875,6.507875,it seems to me that the the benefits of working for a big company tend to be the the same things that that are to their determent,1,0
sw4163A-ms98-a,4,A,14.2,21.9915,7.7915,but when you see a job when you see a a job that needs to be done sometimes you have to fill out the five forms in triplicate in order to to get it done you know what i mean,1,0
sw4163A-ms98-a,10,A,51.366125,64.396625,13.0305,there is that i mean well and then i guess again i- i gue- like i said when i when i started off that the advantages tend to be the same things that the disadvantages i mean if i don't show up for for work there's probably somebody else that could fill my spot but,1,0
sw4163A-ms98-a,11,A,64.396625,70.505375,6.10875,um i imagine and and that's nice but uh it's w- it's also nice to be able to uh,1,0
sw4163A-ms98-a,33,A,155.626875,165.86,10.233125,and if you can get on top of it before before it goes up i mean you know if all of a sudden the company expanded to like you know three thousand people you would probably be one of the top people,1,0
sw4163A-ms98-a,40,A,191.0225,200.175375,9.152875,and uh um  like like it's their i guess another advantage might be that uh if th- if it's big a big enough company and it has multiple sites,1,0
sw4163A-ms98-a,52,A,270.986,278.33175,7.34575, see i'm trying to decide my dad was in the military which is i guess if you figure companies the military would be a pretty big company,1,0
sw4163B-ms98-a,39,B,189.418125,191.0335,1.615375,yeah that would be nice,1,0
sw4163B-ms98-a,46,B,222.200625,232.242875,10.04225,i mean i guess it's nice if you have family that lives somewhere else and you want to be next be near them you can see it switch through the company to over at that state or whatever,2,0
sw4164A-ms98-a,7,A,15.6495,26.6,10.9505,yeah i happen to uh this will be a real short one cause i happen to agree with you uh  i think in principal it is a very very good thing but when you make it mandatory uh now you're talking about slavery,1,0
sw4164A-ms98-a,29,A,144.027125,152.5685,8.541375,you know the question of when do you quote need unquoted on um say for example a draft uh maybe it should be the other way around maybe ,1,0
sw4164A-ms98-a,30,A,152.5685,157.127375,4.558875,the willingness of people to volunteer should be determining whether you need it or not,1,0
sw4164A-ms98-a,32,A,159.489375,170.441125,10.95175,yeah cause uh you know if all you got to do is uh print up a few million draft cards to start a war you know  you it may be a powerful in- you know what do you call it um,1,0
sw4164A-ms98-a,33,A,170.441125,179.517875,9.07675, by volunteer may be a powerful incentive for keeping people out of uh you know keep keeping us out of may make it a little more difficult to get into war you know there are times you need to,1,0
sw4164B-ms98-a,5,B,4.494875,12.48725,7.992375,okay well i you know i think that uh i think it's fine to do that but i don't think it should be mandatory i'm not,1,0
sw4164B-ms98-a,28,B,111.823625,119.22625,7.402625,then i'd say uh possibly i mean but it would to be an emergency type thing and i and i don't see that ever happening uh,1,0
sw4164B-ms98-a,49,B,200.34975,212.9775,12.62775,some thought has to be given to what do we want these people to do in public service and and that would have a bearing on what training should they have because if you wanted to have people you know as an incentive you can have people go in after high school,1,0
sw4164B-ms98-a,50,B,212.9775,227.44925,14.47175,and then offer them assistance with their college and that way you'd be getting people who really didn't have any expertise in any particular but uh any particular field but they'd be willing hands so so to speak on public service projects ,2,0
sw4165A-ms98-a,2,A,0.721375,9.611875,8.8905,like i mentioned Brian and i guess we're going to want to be talking about child care uh do you have any experience in uh finding child care,1,0
sw4165A-ms98-a,18,A,90.91625,98.14875,7.2325,then uh something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to uh accommodate or take care of the kids very well and uh,1,0
sw4165A-ms98-a,40,A,248.307875,254.502875,6.195,don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of so and,1,0
sw4165B-ms98-a,3,B,22.255875,33.944625,11.68875,those many years and uh we didn't do it very much and we i guess we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at uh two family income at the time ,1,0
sw4165B-ms98-a,16,B,153.465,164.666875,11.201875,you know some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care but even you know here i guess we have,1,0
sw4165B-ms98-a,18,B,171.756875,181.28725,9.530375, in one  primarily babysit children in their own home and that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to maybe seven or eight children ,1,0
sw4165B-ms98-a,19,B,181.28725,193.19225,11.905,and then otherwise there will be  the majority are cooperative day cares uh people form a co-op and uh parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours,1,0
sw4165B-ms98-a,20,B,193.19225,198.76525,5.573,frequently they will hire staff to be at the day care and,1,0
sw4165B-ms98-a,21,B,198.76525,211.71975,12.9545, the emphasis is primarily uh someplace for the children to be but at the same time there's some  fairly good training programs ,1,0
sw4166B-ms98-a,8,B,77.43625,85.73775,8.3015,um you know they don't always have their full wits about them they're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on,1,0

sw4170A-ms98-a,6,A,41.364375,46.7055,5.341125,because_1 you're paying for everybody that uses it now and it's not gonna be there when you need it,1,0

sw4178B-ms98-a,23,B,190.5945,203.1195,12.525,because my children are are now have cousins of their own that they'd rather get with and and so i think what's going to happen in the future is it will be from my father on down and and all of his descendants and and tho- those cousins so,1,0
sw4178B-ms98-a,38,B,257.174375,268.42725,11.252875,and uh since she was an employee she knew what the schedule was and knew when it'd be free signed up and and reserved and paid for the place so so we could all show up and it was nice you know there're several cabins there,1,0

sw4180A-ms98-a,60,A,264.60775,272.13725,7.5295,well it does seem like the uh the quality of the bonds that United States sell would eventually be downgraded doesn't it,1,0
sw4180B-ms98-a,6,B,27.248125,33.53525,6.287125,there there seems to be some prob- you know some question on whether there will be actually money there or not,2,0
sw4180B-ms98-a,38,B,246.424125,254.01425,7.590125,tremendously bad circumstances like a war or something we should not be running a deficit economy,1,0

sw4182A-ms98-a,15,A,153.415,161.8425,8.4275,you know part of me says well as long as it's accurate i don't care if they test and if someone is using it they should be you know caught for it as long as it's illegal ,1,0

sw4182B-ms98-a,10,B,60.553,75.33025,14.77725,uh at hand but i think there other ways um other than than doing things like drug testing to monitor the way um people behave um i think a g- for instance a good manager should be able to tell that somebody's got a personal problem um ,1,0
sw4182B-ms98-a,30,B,205.58,213.53225,7.95225,uh are are that i think that the government should ad- administrate it in a com- you know in a completely different manner i think it would be a,1,0
sw4182B-ms98-a,31,B,213.53225,225.8815,12.34925,a good source of revenue i think there's some some evidence about the way this stuff has been handled in Europe that shows that it can be controlled in different ways but that's sort of moving off the topic at hand here and i you know the the ,1,0
sw4183A-ms98-a,15,A,62.164125,71.009625,8.8455,and she's going with me and i mean that's i i'm thinking that she's going to be one of my main sources of of companionship in in the beginning,1,0
sw4183B-ms98-a,29,B,126.668,133.64275,6.97475,and you know there really wasn't a whole lot that could be done other than let it go ahead and finish it off at that point,1,0
sw4183B-ms98-a,59,B,260.49375,268.799,8.30525,well we're trying to get her to be more and more of an outdoor dog right now she's indoors she's still a puppy and needs a lot of social interaction,1,0

sw4185B-ms98-a,38,B,185.215625,194.917875,9.70225,and really left the family completely behind to work on the church and to be you know what everybody would consider to be a good leader of the church,2,0
sw4185B-ms98-a,39,B,194.917875,205.1265,10.208625,right right and and he had more of a desire to be with with the rest of the church members than he did with us and so that that was definitely a problem,1,0
sw4186A-ms98-a,65,A,262.9305,271.063875,8.133375,in terms of um you know whatever happens to be around he'll he'll you know play then he also likes going hunting for,1,0

sw4187B-ms98-a,74,B,261.7985,271.856875,10.058375,and thinking they might be from eastern Europe or something and what they confirmed  our suspicion which was they were basically a bunch of crazed British  no musicologists ,1,0
sw4188A-ms98-a,5,A,28.159875,41.2515,13.091625,and when i talk to the local trash haulers about recycling they said that uh they could haul it to the recycling site but it would be about twenty dollars a month more,1,0
sw4188B-ms98-a,16,B,84.181,85.81675,1.63575,i'll be darned,1,0

sw4189B-ms98-a,34,B,131.992125,136.239625,4.2475,that i hope will be an experience that our kids remember for,1,0
sw4190A-ms98-a,5,A,15.994875,24.75625,8.761375,sort of health care that's available to everybody and the prices just seem to be really escalating the price of medication is is so exuberant,1,0
sw4190B-ms98-a,6,B,42.1965,48.521125,6.324625,and social security as far as helping them_1 in their retirement is not going to be adequate by the time we're,1,0
sw4190B-ms98-a,10,B,57.8915,59.987625,2.096125,there's not going to be anybody that can afford it,1,0
sw4190B-ms98-a,19,B,166.199625,174.118,7.918375,and i thought well does it pay for you to be a fit well individual when your insurance doesn't even cover things like that,1,0
sw4191A-ms98-a,44,A,242.793875,247.83225,5.038375,then they couldn't be fleeing to for political reasons because you know w- we were friends with that government,1,0
sw4191B-ms98-a,9,B,37.092,44.4475,7.3555,a lot of land and a lot of opportunities that uh just don't seem to be available now,1,0
sw4191B-ms98-a,25,B,121.866375,135.4625,13.596125,just just seems to be be fairly strange uh uh either you know oh if we feel that we've been wrong in in keeping the Irish out or whatever it is i- i don't understand,2,0
sw4191B-ms98-a,30,B,148.039625,153.447375,5.40775,that's that's the hard question that that always seems to be the hard question,1,0
sw4192A-ms98-a,21,A,228.897375,238.99925,10.101875,and and i mean there's uh there's a place that used to be called Concrete City and they have all these things where they used to burn um and and what they would burn off would be lead,2,0
sw4192A-ms98-a,24,A,260.23675,271.54675,11.31,you know and so many of these things takes so many years to develop that we've never you know it'll be past my life time before i see the effects of some of the things that we're doing now,1,0
sw4192B-ms98-a,37,B,195.235375,202.497,7.261625,and it's just you know it's ridiculous when we could be spending the money to develop the technology to you know clean up some of these uh ,1,0
sw4192B-ms98-a,59,B,285.178,298.626,13.448,and something really ought to be done because it it's basically we don't see the problem right now and like you said e- the pollution that we're putting out now is not really going to affect anybody for twenty thirty years so i don't think it's got i mean the the p-,1,0
sw4193B-ms98-a,21,B,128.748625,143.4485,14.699875,yeah and and i- i don't even bother with local news because it's it's like you know um i'm a pilot so i'm aware of how how they misrepresent you know it's like a guy would do a gears up landing and it'd be there was a crash landing today and our camera crew was there,1,0
sw4194A-ms98-a,17,A,109.4945,122.310125,12.815625,reminds me years ago i had trouble quitting biting my nails and i read some uh suggestion that said well you know if you keep them_1 all and tape them_1 on a piece of paper and see how many you know nails you're biting off you'll be amazed ,1,0
sw4194A-ms98-a,23,A,152.473,157.225875,4.752875,really that has got to be one of the worst problems we've got here today,1,0
sw4194B-ms98-a,21,B,129.477,136.464875,6.987875,interesting i- i just got a lecture today from my mother about being frivolous she wants me to be more frivolous,1,0
sw4194B-ms98-a,61,B,290.996125,295.487,4.490875,the results can be really terrible and besides it annoys the pig,1,0
sw4195A-ms98-a,64,A,164.4745,179.455125,14.980625,a lot of people frown on that just on on TV in general but i don't know i- i think my own personal opinion is that it it helps to instill a sense of values and moral as long as it could be ex- explained and as long as there's good monitoring going on,1,0
sw4195A-ms98-a,86,A,235.312375,239.756,4.443625,yeah well that's that's important for you to be there then for a lot of the time,1,0
sw4195B-ms98-a,2,B,0.48625,14.998875,14.512625,i have two little girls i have um one seven and one five and a half and um i'm di- i'm just now i'll be divorced this month so i'm pretty much raising my kids myself,1,0
sw4195B-ms98-a,11,B,56.31,65.288875,8.978875,i uh have always been home with them and then when my husband decided he wanted to be free and uh  i,1,0
sw4195B-ms98-a,14,B,77.201625,85.250625,8.049,and um i do it while they're in school and i make my own hours and and i'm home when i want to be home and ,1,0
sw4195B-ms98-a,26,B,122.237625,133.499,11.261375,that'd be about_1 the biggest place you know that i'm from and i'm from a small a smaller city though it's not not that big it's big but it's not that big,1,0
sw4196A-ms98-a,55,A,271.491875,274.765125,3.27325,that can be an important source of news international,1,0
sw4196B-ms98-a,24,B,152.182375,164.471625,12.28925,and uh you know so regional coverage uh is pretty sparse and so we our next step from local tends to be virtually national or international,1,0
sw4196B-ms98-a,32,B,213.9955,226,12.0045,anything that intends to be local interest uh is quite localized Toronto Montreal Ottawa Vancouver that kind of thing you know so you're getting uh,1,0
sw4196B-ms98-a,43,B,273.283875,284.481375,11.1975,yes uh yeah i- i actually i really enjoy their format and so it is it can be quite informative on an international basis uh,1,0
sw4196B-ms98-a,44,B,284.481375,292.4895,8.008125,so um i guess that would probably be my primary source for international news but uh not on a,1,0
sw4196B-ms98-a,45,B,292.4895,299.458,6.9685,regular prescribed basis tend to uh or i happen to be there and i'm and uh,1,0
sw4197A-ms98-a,3,A,11.9975,24.4915,12.494,um i think the government waste a lot of the money um and spends it on purposes that that the government really shouldn't be spending it on um i don't think that it's effectively used,1,0
sw4197A-ms98-a,21,A,110.495875,121.795375,11.2995,i'm kind of a state's right person and i think that a lot of of what the federal government could do could be handled uh more efficiently uh on a state level,1,0
sw4197A-ms98-a,24,A,135.99925,148.68475,12.6855,um you know i mean there there are some things that our taxes need to be spent on um at a federal level like national uh defense and uh you know common rule making and things like that um ,1,0
sw4197A-ms98-a,25,A,148.68475,158.003125,9.318375,but i think a lot of it could be handed over to the states you know especially things like welfare and and you know food stamps that kind of programs um so,1,0
sw4197B-ms98-a,7,B,35.235375,44.4955,9.260125,needs to happen in this country that isn't happening and that not that the government necessarily should be the agent through which it's accomplished but,1,0
sw4197B-ms98-a,43,B,223.488625,236.033375,12.54475,i don't know it seems like somehow not enough is being done to educate people there and things like that to to be able to participate with yeah the rest of us in the in the world it's just pre elitist but,1,0
sw4198A-ms98-a,19,A,173.9985,188,14.0015,although if the entire incumbent mood holds up we may there may be some changes this fall i'm not sure they're they're kind of strange because there are a lot of incumbents running as outsiders now,1,0
sw4198B-ms98-a,7,B,33.807,43.1755,9.3685,and  seems like taxes go up and and benefits go down i don't quite understand it all i think it must be a result of centralization ,1,0
sw4198B-ms98-a,23,B,124.981625,138.48825,13.506625,uh the local uh economy and the local residence to have uh regional airports around the Dallas area then why the hell would it be uh important to the federal government,1,0
sw4198B-ms98-a,24,B,138.48825,150.782375,12.294125,and to use uh the fact that you could leverage this and really only pay for a small fraction of it by virtue of having federal funds seems to me to be a good example of why,1,0
sw4198B-ms98-a,34,B,273.48425,278.02475,4.5405,it's hard to be ethical i think,1,0
sw4198B-ms98-a,35,B,278.02475,280.493625,2.468875,that must be why we see so many,1,0
sw4198B-ms98-a,36,B,280.493625,285.491875,4.99825,that i mean it's hard to be ethical when you are a powerful person is what i meant to say,1,0
sw4198B-ms98-a,37,B,285.491875,289.754,4.262125,that may be why we see so many corrupt officials,1,0
sw4199A-ms98-a,81,A,256.992625,259.479,2.486375,boy that should be fun,1,0
sw4200A-ms98-a,45,A,206.99525,213.98725,6.992,pub- uh journal publications for uh i guess that would be more of keeping up in in terms of the work that i do ,1,0
sw4200B-ms98-a,19,B,112.981625,116.00925,3.027625,uh they tend to be really,1,0
sw4201A-ms98-a,39,A,219.485875,230.465375,10.9795,well even though i could've probably used a truck better the last time around i probably will still get a car the next time around figuring that'll be more useful in the future,1,0
sw4201A-ms98-a,44,A,241.74525,244.77625,3.031,that'll be the main criterion,1,0
sw4201B-ms98-a,19,B,84.995875,92.25575,7.259875,well our next vehicle is going to be a a full size truck well we're kind of getting little ,1,0
sw4201B-ms98-a,32,B,160.480125,171.479625,10.9995,yeah yeah like i say like i'm we're kind of moving out in a mini truck and into the full size will be the next one so,1,0
sw4202A-ms98-a,28,A,160.05925,169.311625,9.252375,and it apparently doesn't have to be sorted they haven't quite reached my neighborhood  but they're doing all sorts of smart things uh,1,0
sw4202A-ms98-a,29,A,169.311625,175.73325,6.421625,they no longer allow grass clippings to be bagged up in plastic bags and put out by the trash,1,0
sw4202A-ms98-a,36,A,201.37675,214.624875,13.248125,and i don't know whether i don't know whether it'll be available to the to the citizens of the town or whether it will just be used in the parks and recreation department or something i i don't know i guess it really doesn't matter ,2,0
sw4202A-ms98-a,47,A,272.146625,284.19325,12.046625,but it in order for it to be cost effective you have to have customers for it you have to have people say i won't have i won't buy paper unless it's recycled,1,0
sw4203A-ms98-a,3,A,2.24325,5.60175,3.3585,what things in your life do you find to be invasion of privacy,1,0
sw4203A-ms98-a,11,A,46.512625,55.08475,8.572125,anything that really bothered me in everyday life um although the thing you mention probably or probably everything about them probably would be true but um,1,0
sw4203A-ms98-a,16,A,67.930625,77.114625,9.184, the cop will staple your the ticket to your license so you know when you go to court you will be able to get your license back um  someone point it out to me you know that,1,0
sw4203B-ms98-a,5,B,11.326625,19.968125,8.6415, keeping records of everything that's sadistic on me i consider that to be an invasion of privacy privacy and i find that it's,1,0
sw4203B-ms98-a,19,B,113.685,127.5175,13.8325, for all we know we don't know what's on what's on their data base before all we know when actually ca- uh call in to check on us uh there may be a little print out says that uh arrested seven times convicted none,1,0
sw4203B-ms98-a,20,B,127.5175,134.635375,7.117875,i mean there maybe maybe that kind of detail involved  he may be called upon it may uh the next,1,0
sw4203B-ms98-a,25,B,145.54025,156.608,11.06775,that and and i well i in fact actually i consider radar detection to be sort of an invasion  i think that that uh we have uh entirely to much uh,1,0
sw4203B-ms98-a,36,B,207.337875,213.722875,6.385,i could drive a hundred and ten and be safer than most of Sunday drivers on their,1,0
sw4204A-ms98-a,8,A,26.3545,36.81625,10.46175,like you want you know m- my answer to a car is it's okay if it ugly um it ok- depending on the  there is a they're bunch of other things that okay that it is it got to be reliable there is no excuse for that ,1,0
sw4204A-ms98-a,58,A,236.60925,242.005125,5.395875, use use to be they req- uh penalty for  doing it but i don't think it's true any more,1,0
sw4204A-ms98-a,62,A,245.69175,254.753625,9.061875,yeah absolutely um you know but there may be other bigger factors so if you decide to replace this ten year old vehicle what is the prime contender right know,1,0

sw4206A-ms98-a,16,A,66.73075,72.4665,5.73575,should keep an eye on them i- i think that should be the the deciding factor in um-hum,1,0
sw4206A-ms98-a,61,A,221.167125,224.36375,3.196625,be you know they should not be hypocritical about it,2,0

sw4206B-ms98-a,6,B,15.91475,27.141125,11.226375,maybe it not quite should not be quite as a as wide spread as i as i use to think it should be you know maybe in certain depends on the job really you know,2,0
sw4206B-ms98-a,7,B,27.141125,37.2165,10.075375,i happen to work uh in a medical profession and uh i work at a hospital and i think that's a good one that that it should be required at you know i myself wouldn't mind taking it,1,0

sw4207A-ms98-a,1,A,0,9.18125,9.18125, uh actually it took me quite a while to get someone uh about six minutes so i have had some time to think about this and you know what is been done and what's could be done and what should be done,2,0
sw4207A-ms98-a,27,A,153.18225,158.307375,5.125125,sort of making it an automated part of garbage pick-up uh seems to be a step forward,1,0
sw4207A-ms98-a,44,A,295.420375,298.53,3.109625,yeah it would be nice if we had a continuing cycle here where every,1,0
sw4207B-ms98-a,14,B,121.999625,129.974125,7.9745,yeah basic basically your garbage is  inspected if they find certain contraband    you can be fined for it  it,1,0

sw4243B-ms98-a,15,B,81.08625,94.255125,13.168875,arson to be a heinous crime and child molestation to be less severe so the sentence wouldn't be all that uniformed i mean obviously it would be uniform within the parameters of that judge him- him or herself,4,0
sw4243B-ms98-a,23,B,141.747,153.629375,11.882375,be portrayed by his lawyer as a loving family man and and uh color the color the jury's opinions but um i don't know,1,0
sw4244B-ms98-a,9,B,35.6655,48.363,12.6975,that they shouldn't be put in a home but there's th- a very hard question o- of what happens when someone isn't able to provide that care for themselves ,1,0
sw4244B-ms98-a,18,B,93.291625,98.837875,5.54625,but yet would still be there to help provide some of the basic services ,1,0
sw4244B-ms98-a,28,B,141.442625,150.001,8.558375,uh he's going to be completely responsible for this only because he happens to live right there with with my in-laws ,1,0
sw4244B-ms98-a,30,B,158.213375,166.774125,8.56075,that that ha- we've all thought about that fortunately uh that doesn't seem to be a big problem but ,1,0
sw4244B-ms98-a,31,B,166.774125,173.092875,6.31875,th- we there's some thought that has to be given to to uh ,1,0
sw4244B-ms98-a,33,B,179.2375,192.681,13.4435,and what no one wants to see is uh that land having to be sold off simply to keep her in a in a nursing home what we'd like to do ,1,0
sw4244B-ms98-a,34,B,192.681,207.1155,14.4345,is uh find the sort of place where i t- described before where  she'd be able to have uh a place of her own but yet also have someone come in a couple of times a day to help her with various ,1,0
sw4244B-ms98-a,56,B,282.86175,290.95475,8.093,you really weren't going to uh you know be around that much longer and so the level of care required ,1,0
sw4245B-ms98-a,38,B,236.04425,243.581,7.53675,now it's not my position to advise and i don't have that  experience with it certainly sounds like a bill of goods trying to be sold to you,1,0
sw4246A-ms98-a,17,A,46.412375,55.238625,8.82625,would they essentially in terms of mag- magnetism would they go like reverse polarity there so you'd actually get pushed along or would it be actually a draw,1,0
sw4246A-ms98-a,49,A,180.50675,190.15925,9.6525,you know things like that can be very well uh studied from space you know and using satellites and space technology and things like that,1,0
sw4246A-ms98-a,50,A,190.15925,200.41325,10.254,uh i think that's real important and if we if we don't look at that closely we could be really screwing ourselves uh,1,0
sw4246B-ms98-a,29,B,255.532,262.76775,7.23575,i think it would you know i think it's obvious to everyone that it would be highly profitable uh once you've reached a certain level it just takes,1,0
sw4246B-ms98-a,31,B,275.42875,284.20225,8.7735,where do i work um i used to be uh an auditor uh for one of the big six accounting firms i'm currently uh,1,0
sw4247A-ms98-a,15,A,74.1905,77.277,3.0865,turned out to be about half that ,1,0
sw4247B-ms98-a,16,B,62.696625,65.26925,2.572625,so it's going to be a monster,1,0
sw4247B-ms98-a,41,B,156.0585,165.196375,9.137875,yeah yeah but you know but get l- i got little kids and they they do a pretty good job of taking care of the dog and so forth so that'll be fun for them,1,0
sw4248A-ms98-a,1,A,0,14.067625,14.067625, well this is something i just got back from working out yes um i'd spend about five or ten minutes stretching and then i i used to be just a walker i i was really into walking about_1 three miles everyday and,1,0
sw4248A-ms98-a,22,A,131.678125,145.31575,13.637625,so i'm knocking close on a year just to be you know m- you know almost but um i'm just i really i had a partner last semester in school that was into body building and he'd been in it for about three years,1,0
sw4248A-ms98-a,63,A,279.005,291.094125,12.089125, well i'm going to wait a long time till that happens i'm i'm i'll be twenty May sixth and i'm just going to get through college and hopefully move to some different states,1,0
sw4249A-ms98-a,44,A,215.50725,222.247,6.73975,i know but i just think it's it must be hard to do in an apartment thing like this,1,0
sw4249A-ms98-a,51,A,270.013875,278.477375,8.4635,so i mean but i mean people do need to realize that that there's not always going to be land,1,0
sw4249B-ms98-a,20,B,72.253,77.48575,5.23275,i mean what do you think they ought to be doing down there in terms of doing more recycling and things like that,1,0
sw4249B-ms98-a,30,B,141.460375,145.4635,4.003125,so i think they could be doing more if they here in Rochester,1,0
sw4249B-ms98-a,53,B,208.98675,215.997,7.01025,oh wow so you'd have to get everything together and take it over there that'd be a real pain they ought to do the curb side stuff,1,0
sw4250A-ms98-a,26,A,159.192875,167.682875,8.49,and that that may just be that may just be me or you know whatever i'm sure i'm sure when i get older i'll  i'll be more of a workout but,3,0
sw4250A-ms98-a,37,A,215.785625,228.98525,13.199625,because it's sort of the same work out but but yeah i can  i sort of you know am able to you know sleep better and and be more uh more alert um when i'm you know when i am awake if i if i exercise regularly so it really,1,0
sw4250B-ms98-a,71,B,278.94775,289.993625,11.045875,um-hum i used to uh years ago play tennis but again uh as you get older tennis is pretty rough on the knees i'm sure handball would be also,1,0
sw4251B-ms98-a,38,B,157.99425,165.944375,7.950125,yeah well there's a lot of money in that and where there's a lot of money there tends to be a lot of uh,1,0
sw4251B-ms98-a,52,B,216.499875,225.701125,9.20125,i got another theory if you want to hear it it's not really mine just that the uh the powers that be mainly you and me,1,0
sw4252A-ms98-a,11,A,38.994125,43.995,5.000875,well what do you think about like automatic weapons and stuff i mean those can't be used for hunting,1,0
sw4252A-ms98-a,53,A,182.256,190.999875,8.743875,uh that it's really im- you know it'd be impossible to it'd be impossible to do anyway i mean people would buy them_1 regardless whether it was uh legal or ill- illegal i think,2,0
sw4252A-ms98-a,68,A,273.23425,277.98525,4.751,i don't i don't know if there's anything that can be if gun control would solve that problem,1,0
sw4252A-ms98-a,72,A,284.485125,291.47625,6.991125,and besides th- i don't think i think the NRA's got such a big lobby that i don't think  they'd be able to,1,0
sw4252B-ms98-a,4,B,2.231,12.490125,10.259125,well let's see um generally i don't think there should be much gun control uh i like to i like to do a lot of hunting and i have my own gun at home and stuff but,1,0
sw4252B-ms98-a,5,B,12.490125,16.99875,4.508625,uh the older i get i think the more i   ought to be gun control,1,0
sw4252B-ms98-a,11,B,51.981,65.49375,13.51275, even then  you're that bad it probably wouldn't help any anyway just  help you kill li- i mean up in Virginia a lot of hunters get killed anyway just with shotguns you know so i can't imagine what it'd be like if they're doing it with automatic weapons ,1,0
sw4252B-ms98-a,22,B,112.014625,126.46525,14.450625,yeah i think uh you're supposed to do that also you have to be real careful uh about what the animal's been eating you know like uh if you ever hunt pheasant you know sometimes they get into corn that's been uh like you know has mercury on it or something and,1,0
sw4252B-ms98-a,30,B,189.49075,201.02425,11.5335,doesn't that kind of strike you as  especially in big cities that uh you know the law enforcement agencies aren't really capable of of providing the kind of protection that you they should be able to provide,1,0
sw4252B-ms98-a,46,B,246.378625,259.265375,12.88675,and uh if they if they suddenly pass a really global law that says you can't have any guns you know there i mean there's guaranteed to be a higher percentage of people just breaking in assuming that these guys don't have any guns and ,1,0
sw4252B-ms98-a,56,B,289.496875,299.074,9.577125,yeah clearly they have some other motive you know i mean the- their argument used to be you know the communist were going to take over or something well they aren't anymore you know so what's the argument now well,1,0
sw4253A-ms98-a,23,A,149.970125,162.701,12.730875,completely slaughter a family and there's always got to be one person saying that they should have a chance to live and that the person who did the murdering should have a chance to live and i just don't think that's right i think it just makes me,1,0
sw4253A-ms98-a,25,A,171.187125,185.491375,14.30425,just so that they'll they can understand all the pain that they're going through and you know then they wouldn't be saying well that killer has a life too because it's not true the as soon as the killer kills someone th- they should deserve to die their life is over too ,1,0
sw4253B-ms98-a,6,B,14.496875,24.228625,9.73175,thing that i would  think that needs to be done you know to great le- uh how should say it uh not wholesale or something to be shunned at all costs ,2,0
sw4253B-ms98-a,21,B,99.645375,113.98775,14.342375,and he said now i have a uh we have somebody who has the will and the ability to be good but instead they choose to be very bad they can destroy an- lives and and uh uh an- and if not your life your uh ,2,0
sw4254A-ms98-a,10,A,40.467875,46.995625,6.52775,maybe uh money used for some kind of wellness program like to join a fitness center or something like that would be,1,0
sw4254A-ms98-a,11,A,46.995625,48.957875,1.96225, be interested in seeing,1,0
sw4254A-ms98-a,23,A,101.27825,104.788,3.50975,you know look at the you'd be eligible for the uh,1,0
sw4254A-ms98-a,37,A,144.481,151.472375,6.991375,the other people that are on the verge or already have missiles that those kinds of systems would be good at uh you know early detection,1,0
sw4254A-ms98-a,55,A,218.498625,227.959625,9.461,so so like a consistent work load would that be kind of a  is that  i don't know if that's considered a benefit it's just in kind of part of the environment you're in ,1,0
sw4255B-ms98-a,13,B,45.765625,55.231125,9.4655,focus right now is getting my dissertation finished and so my workouts tend to be limited to going swimming,1,0
sw4256A-ms98-a,35,A,112.00525,123.7115,11.70625,okay yeah i'm not real sure about that i've only been up here a little while so i'm still kind of getting the hang of it but actually i'll be back down in May to finish my degree so uh that'll be good,2,0
sw4256A-ms98-a,40,A,138.72375,150.228625,11.504875,all right great well i'll probably be using    i hope when i get back give me a good vehicle to do my dissertation on maybe but uh yeah actually that it's  and all those people,1,0
sw4256A-ms98-a,59,A,228.291625,232.264125,3.9725,presumably that's supposed to be the paycheck right but who's to say,1,0
sw4256B-ms98-a,36,B,125.964875,139.450875,13.486,uh in fact yes i do uh as soon as i get out of some work i'm doing right now i'll be talking to them uh uh and getting some low cost uh uh equipment together to do some uh human factor studies,1,0
sw4256B-ms98-a,40,B,148.997,152.78075,3.78375,right i'll be working with uh uh Carolyn Carolyn Prince,1,0
sw4256B-ms98-a,64,B,244.501,257.76275,13.26175,yeah there was a lot of uh thought put into that because_1 i i- i because_1 when i go to other new facilities whether it be uh uh uh uh McDonald Douglas some of the other new facilities i've been to there's,1,0
sw4256B-ms98-a,67,B,266.01425,273.526375,7.512125,yeah oh well the architect tries to throw it in but uh sometimes i wonder when they put back the people that's supposed to be monitoring the building,1,0
sw4257A-ms98-a,14,A,84.495125,98.99875,14.503625,i i think that's almost necessary i and it's interesting that compassion has got to be a required quality but then they yet they have to have the ability to isolate themselves from too much too much compassion,1,0
sw4257A-ms98-a,26,A,141.99825,156.495875,14.497625,that's true and i think it would be i would think it would be helpful to the patient to um be housed with uh patients with similar uh ha- you know similar problems,3,0
sw4257A-ms98-a,28,A,158.97625,163.99625,5.02,just so that they could relate to one another and and wouldn't you know be,1,0
sw4257A-ms98-a,36,A,207.734875,214.453875,6.719,and i find that psychologically very interesting because_1 i i feel from my perspective that it would be a a manifestation of their own frus-,1,0
sw4257A-ms98-a,39,A,218.9835,225.686375,6.702875,and and that um would would i don't know that that frustration would be preventable in ,1,0
sw4257A-ms98-a,47,A,257.975125,267.001625,9.0265,um-hum what um do the- did you find um that they offered sufficient dietary maintenance that would be something i would,1,0
sw4257B-ms98-a,5,B,21.276125,28.49225,7.216125,and um uh they can be mentally sane one day and just look perfectly normal and then the next day they're just,1,0
sw4257B-ms98-a,27,B,123.7135,136.788875,13.075375,or if he could if they could be up and around it all depends on the type of nursing home they have the ones where they live in apartments even and just get their meals and care there you know that way,1,0
sw4258A-ms98-a,67,A,278.478625,282.463125,3.9845,although i could see where that would be that could be a lot of fun,2,0
sw4258B-ms98-a,8,B,38.718375,51.499,12.780625,right and and the the programs have to be wider uh when i went to the Catholic high school uh there was nothing but a college preparatory course,1,0
sw4258B-ms98-a,27,B,156.996625,166.961,9.964375,i do- i don't think that there are the resources in most public schools to be able to say well what we need here is a,1,0
sw4259A-ms98-a,66,A,247.732,256.702625,8.970625,well the register ran it which i think was the right role and privilege and i would be packing pulled out a quarter of a million in advertising,1,0
sw4259B-ms98-a,7,B,20.820625,28.214875,7.39425,e- except for giving you sports and weather and telling you the story is going to be coming just after this commercial,1,0
sw4259B-ms98-a,62,B,279.792625,282.970625,3.178,but they at least make the effort to be,1,0
sw4260B-ms98-a,21,B,63.445,69.7095,6.2645,i would have thought that uh this time of the year here i might be able to get out a little bit but uh,1,0
sw4260B-ms98-a,22,B,69.7095,74.825375,5.115875,Winter seems to be dragging on up here and we have snow right now,1,0
sw4260B-ms98-a,37,B,151.4545,155.05675,3.60225,oh okay you did that so that must be fairly common,1,0
sw4260B-ms98-a,60,B,280.599125,289.145625,8.5465,so i i figured i- it might be a good investment i i better be sure and serious about getting into it or else the uh the investment isn't very good,2,0
sw4261A-ms98-a,1,A,0,8.421625,8.421625, served on jury duty but it's ironic because i have a summons here for the thirtieth which is the Monday after next and i'll be a little more authoritative on this after then,1,0
sw4261A-ms98-a,6,A,23.089,35.050625,11.961625,yeah i would think that um sentencing would be the kind of thing that an expert system would be ideal for you know there's a whole bunch of evidence that's supposed to be weighed and for nice uniform sentencing for particular things,3,0
sw4261A-ms98-a,7,A,35.050625,40.483125,5.4325,it would um seem like the perfect solution but i suppose that would be really subject to abuse as well,1,0
sw4261A-ms98-a,10,A,61.446875,67.303125,5.85625,there was some guy that was convicted and he volunteered to be castrated i guess that was down in your area uh,1,0
sw4261A-ms98-a,12,A,70.915875,79.3545,8.438625,and then here they've gone and um no surgeon could be found to perform the job so the judge went and withdrew the whole idea or something like that,1,0
sw4261A-ms98-a,14,A,89.376625,100.885625,11.509,yeah one thing i would certainly like to see is that um criminals be sentenced to some sort of a uh a means of paying for their um incarceration,1,0
sw4261A-ms98-a,21,A,138.546375,143.15425,4.607875,yeah i would think there's a lot that a lot of production that c- could be done um,1,0
sw4261A-ms98-a,37,A,257.663875,265.273125,7.60925,yeah there seems to be a lot of problems with the uh criminal justice system in America today i'm certainly no one to have the answers,1,0
sw4261B-ms98-a,6,B,40.25425,46.237625,5.983375,well uh i guess it could be but i- i- i agree with you in that to the extent that i i think i-,1,0
sw4261B-ms98-a,7,B,46.237625,56.99825,10.760625,it largely would be more uniform i think uh as a opposed to a a real mixture of juries with in different locations and different you know ideas,1,0
sw4261B-ms98-a,22,B,151.866,158.49325,6.62725,uh th- the other question i guess that that to be addressed is uh whether uh,1,0
sw4261B-ms98-a,30,B,200.827375,203.451375,2.624,and it seems like it should just be,1,0
sw4261B-ms98-a,34,B,221.474,234.616125,13.142125,well it has to right now it has to be unanimous on most of those decisions if not it's a hung jury and uh they're asked to stay in and try to come up with the unanimous verdict and then if eventually it's uh,1,0
sw4261B-ms98-a,36,B,242.638,248.86325,6.22525,um even if just one person is is holding out or can't be convinced to uh to vote guilty,1,0
sw4262B-ms98-a,3,B,26.295875,36.397375,10.1015,oh yeah there seems to be a little bit of bias towards extracurricular stuff even all the way up through college,1,0
sw4262B-ms98-a,21,B,144.630625,147.773125,3.1425,so there'd be a lively discussion in the class,1,0
sw4262B-ms98-a,22,B,147.773125,158.093,10.319875,if if no one cared you know it didn't matter if the teacher was exciting or not it'd be he'd be ta- he or she'd be talking at you,3,0
sw4262B-ms98-a,27,B,172.059125,179.8415,7.782375,so to me uh i'm i'm gonna go back and say it's the students have got to be looking to learn uh ,1,0
sw4262B-ms98-a,28,B,179.8415,182.72725,2.88575,they've got to be curious,1,0
sw4262B-ms98-a,36,B,205.181875,209.268875,4.087,yeah t- to be interested and you know you talk t-,1,0
sw4263A-ms98-a,70,A,257.6815,265.081125,7.399625,i think with s- with so many parents working both husband and wife that it's difficult to find time for everybody to be together,1,0
sw4263B-ms98-a,3,B,4.155375,10.434375,6.279,uh we have two they're going to be two and four years old in April,1,0
sw4263B-ms98-a,18,B,113.354375,124.484625,11.13025,we uh pretty much uh be- between that thousand mile distance from uh relatives and the fact that we had uh uh eighteen years together ,1,0
sw4265A-ms98-a,16,A,66.851,70.309625,3.458625,i used to do a lot of that i- it can be a lot of fun,1,0
sw4265B-ms98-a,4,B,13.4445,17.844,4.3995,um i happen to be an opponent of gun control,1,0
sw4265B-ms98-a,6,B,19.114875,21.53,2.415125,i happen to be um,1,0
sw4265B-ms98-a,63,B,225.4235,233.5825,8.159,well in order to prevent a crime the police have to be where the crime is taking place now they can't be everywhere they can be very good at deterring crime,3,0
sw4265B-ms98-a,64,B,233.5825,239.76575,6.18325,they can be very good capturing criminals and enforcing the punishment of crime but they can't be good at preventing it,2,0
sw4266B-ms98-a,5,B,19.20925,25.907875,6.698625,yeah that's an interesting point i work in uh the computer business which tends to be pretty,1,0
sw4267A-ms98-a,5,A,35.024375,39.702125,4.67775,i'd probably be closer to uh on the one side ,1,0
sw4267A-ms98-a,10,A,60.58375,70.787625,10.203875,i mean maybe there's a way they can be uh maintained in a a certain location i don't know but i don't know if individual ownership is necessary,1,0
sw4267A-ms98-a,22,A,106.527375,114.29925,7.771875,once again i think i- it may be better to keep the guns uh there and l- they can go there and and use them_1 if that's all they need it for,1,0
sw4267A-ms98-a,33,A,145.400125,152.247875,6.84775,well they can always be tweaked around and made deadly once again ,1,0
sw4267A-ms98-a,37,A,167.679875,176.714375,9.0345,yeah i do- i don't openly i don't i think any gu- any gun can be modified to to ce- a certain extent to be used as a weapon,2,0
sw4267A-ms98-a,38,A,176.714375,181.63575,4.921375,so without a total ban there's always going to be guns available but,1,0
sw4267A-ms98-a,59,A,267.494125,281.782375,14.28825,if you look at the NRA's position on it they tend to say that they don't want they really don't want to have any restrictions because they feel that once you get one and it's start- it be gets easier and it may snowball into more restrictions i don't really respect that position,1,0
sw4267B-ms98-a,40,B,180.2235,184.135375,3.911875,yeah and i think even with a total ban there'll always be guns available,1,0
sw4267B-ms98-a,45,B,208.612625,217.056125,8.4435,but i also ascribe to the theory that you know you know guns guns don't kill people people kill people i mean that that seems to me to be wrong,1,0
sw4267B-ms98-a,53,B,254.589875,265.59325,11.003375,so you know i- i- it goes to sh- i- it does prove that even even you know g- gun control certainly has a place but it's not going to be the the cure all of all society's ills,1,0
sw4268A-ms98-a,27,A,248.93225,254.71475,5.7825,i don't know how many parents would be willing to take their children,1,0
sw4268B-ms98-a,14,B,150.4865,158.6805,8.194,uh uh the you have to come get them there's a problem and one of the things i would like to see would be a type of day care service ,1,0
sw4268B-ms98-a,24,B,258.059875,262.54125,4.481375,oh that's that's another reason why i would preferred it to be with the same services,1,0
sw4268B-ms98-a,30,B,285.702875,296.502125,10.79925,for the night where you know they would be there with you and you can stop in at anytime on your break so that your the check and balances of the type of care is subject to anybody stopping in anytime,1,0
sw4269B-ms98-a,14,B,29.747875,39.25575,9.507875,no actually i it's like i i have a com- i s- when i went to grad school i uh i realized that having a computer would be,1,0
sw4270A-ms98-a,50,A,179.757875,190.525875,10.768,you're supposed to be adults why don't you get with the program and work out your problems instead of having to to go through all this in front of a jury it just seemed it just seemed dumb at the time,1,0
sw4270A-ms98-a,77,A,251.486375,254.68575,3.199375,well yeah what the value would be equal to today,1,0
sw4270B-ms98-a,27,B,237.18925,247.6285,10.43925,basically what it means is uh they try to say you know like uh petty things you don't get a jury and nowadays that same twenty five dollars might be i don't know ,1,0
sw4271B-ms98-a,46,B,256.72125,267.783125,11.061875,i told her and i said i'm waiting for them to file that and they said if the mortgage pay- you know check gets that before that and i said but it should be you know i it should be deposited before it hits but,2,0
sw4272B-ms98-a,22,B,68.4945,73.081,4.5865,well i think there's got to be clauses as far as in capital punishment that,1,0
sw4272B-ms98-a,27,B,86.035,88.982125,2.947125,something like that i don't think would be substantial enough,1,0
sw4272B-ms98-a,29,B,96.762375,100.177875,3.4155,that's a clear case of a person who should be executed,1,0
sw4272B-ms98-a,33,B,111.578375,117.256,5.677625,they uh the person that perpetuates the crime deserves to be uh punished,1,0
sw4272B-ms98-a,57,B,210.2995,213.612125,3.312625,and i don't really think that we should be doing something like that,1,0
sw4272B-ms98-a,68,B,257.9495,265.99575,8.04625,is it really worth spending all that time effort to rehabilitate someone who you may never ever be able to rehabilitate,1,0
sw4272B-ms98-a,69,B,265.99575,270.98225,4.9865,and who it's questionable whether you should be rehabilitated them_1 in rehabilitating them in the first place,1,0
sw4273A-ms98-a,43,A,172.069625,177.23025,5.160625,oh so so every year your kids had to do like some kind of a test to be sure that okay,1,0
sw4273B-ms98-a,25,B,127.311,137.23475,9.92375,you know they needed they just needed other kids to be learning with you know and uh also it was a tremendous amount of work,1,0
sw4273B-ms98-a,39,B,197.829625,211.553875,13.72425,i mean that testing can be really bogus you know because_1 we knew people in uh the home schoolers associations there that just they were just blatant cheaters    if their kid didn't do well yeah i mean they just filled it out themselves it was absurd you know,1,0
sw4273B-ms98-a,43,B,217.094375,226.332375,9.238,yeah so you know for us we actually sat our kid down and timed them_1 and everything you know just make it seem like like the real pressure you'd be under,1,0
sw4273B-ms98-a,50,B,261.5115,264.287625,2.776125,she knew that public schools could be pretty bad,1,0
sw4273B-ms98-a,56,B,278.688375,282.42225,3.733875,t- you know my opinion is that they should there should be a public school,1,0
sw4273B-ms98-a,57,B,282.42225,295.2975,12.87525,they they shouldn't make everybody go to it i mean you should be able to go to other schools or if you know if people have the credentials to home school well leave them_1 alone but but uh you know as far as the taxes go i mean i don't yeah yeah big deal nah,1,0
sw4274A-ms98-a,35,A,155.07625,157.6935,2.61725,it's happens to be traditionally,1,0
sw4274A-ms98-a,37,A,160.442375,168.076375,7.634,uh how should i say it it has to be traditionally accepted that the drug testing in my mind is is really to spot the extreme user,1,0
sw4274B-ms98-a,6,B,30.294875,41.641875,11.347,especially since they're only testing for certain things they're not testing for other things uh that could be impairing your ability to perform the job,1,0
sw4274B-ms98-a,25,B,187.63225,201.771,14.13875,you know if you get into a period where you're very very stressed on your job or very very stressed in your life then you're going to be you know if you have the predisposition then you can turn and your habit goes up and that's very true of alcoholism,1,0
sw4274B-ms98-a,38,B,278.98375,289.67975,10.696,uh i i i think that's to a large extent most people you know let's le- take alcohol since that seems to be the more public knowledge and more studied of these type of things ,1,0
sw4275B-ms98-a,4,B,5.650125,15.962875,10.31275,yeah we have two we have uh a four year old and a two year old at least they will be in April i'm getting used to calling them that since they're all prepared for their birthdays,1,0
sw4275B-ms98-a,13,B,76.251,84.993125,8.742125,uh we've been pretty fortunate we've had babysitters that tend to be in their late teens they drive over in their own cars,1,0
sw4275B-ms98-a,20,B,132.792375,144.924,12.131625,uh you know parents that that watch and neighbors she lives in a neighborhood that has a lot of uh young families and our neighbors seem to be mostly retired,1,0
sw4275B-ms98-a,34,B,248.197625,255.213,7.015375,meaning that uh they're they seem to be pretty lax in in who comes in and who watches them,1,0
sw4276A-ms98-a,6,A,35.589625,50.1005,14.510875,no no i don't think so either i i was also kind of surprised that uh i don't maybe maybe there were technical uh limitations on what could be done but it it seemed like a perfect opportunity for the uh United States space program to,1,0
sw4276A-ms98-a,12,A,88.05625,96.693125,8.636875,right how do you feel as far as spending uh the tremendous amounts of money that need to be spent to keep the program going how do you feel about,1,0
sw4276A-ms98-a,16,A,122.95375,132.282625,9.328875,although i guess uh certain logic could be  to figure out how much spending it can do in any given year or period of years ,1,0
sw4276A-ms98-a,17,A,132.282625,145.650875,13.36825,but i'd like to see you hear talk about this uh future space station that may be built may serve as a a uh intermediate point between like a trip to Mars or something like that and,1,0
sw4276A-ms98-a,18,A,145.650875,153.003,7.352125,seems like the next next big step that needs to be taken is interplanetary travel but that also seems so,1,0
sw4276A-ms98-a,34,A,248.591125,254.470875,5.87975,they had plans for these things and they sent them_1 up years and years ago and they never expected them_1 to be still transmitting data back,1,0
sw4276B-ms98-a,14,B,60.50225,69.3305,8.82825,well i think uh may- something like that may be in the works in the future trying to get some joint ventures between the two countries in terms of space exploration,1,0
sw4276B-ms98-a,34,B,172.591375,185.753125,13.16175,but i've also read a lot of bad things about it how they're talking about the value of the space station is very limited in the amount of information that can be gathered is is minimal but,1,0

sw4287A-ms98-a,35,A,142.155125,149.202875,7.04775,because_1 it's just it's number one it's none of their business and it and it doesn't ha- they want it they want it to be put on your check,1,0
sw4287A-ms98-a,47,A,184.376,191.501,7.125,but see what's happening though is that it's starting be in- to goi- they're going to try to integrate it into the stores too,1,0

sw4288A-ms98-a,45,A,205.6145,219.81,14.1955,i that whenever they brought this up that kind of caught me off guard you know i think you know the way i got into mine was they did it it they started it in junior high school and it could just be like an extracurricular club that you could become involved in,1,0
sw4288A-ms98-a,58,A,282.631,293.393875,10.762875,and and it one other thing you've got to really look at is uh depending on what age group you're going to involve you know be it high school or whatever you've got to have good adult mentors,1,0
sw4288B-ms98-a,12,B,65.90625,69.823875,3.917625,things and i think that would be good for youth because it would,1,0
sw4288B-ms98-a,14,B,71.264,78.125875,6.861875,be an experience that they it would be difficult to get under a lot of circumstances unless you're involved in some ki- kind of,2,0
sw4288B-ms98-a,17,B,108.116125,114.88725,6.771125,yeah i could see that happening um i- i would think with enough publicity there's got to be a wide enough variety of,1,0
sw4288B-ms98-a,24,B,156.640625,164.345125,7.7045,yeah i think the Peace Corps would be uh scary for a lot of people because of that isolation  even if they were in teams it would be ,2,0
sw4288B-ms98-a,28,B,180.752125,188.038375,7.28625,i guess that'd be it i- i would find i find it hard to imagine maintaining an incentive i or maybe not,1,0
sw4288B-ms98-a,37,B,248.84275,258.615625,9.772875,would be key to just s- staying away from that feeling of being forced into it whether they were officially forced into it or just the pressure was so high to stay in or meet a,1,0
sw4289A-ms98-a,50,A,152.840875,160.792875,7.952,oh yeah well we go to you know we go to San Antonio a lot to be with them during like Thanksgiving or Christmas so,1,0
sw4289B-ms98-a,17,B,48.152875,52.251625,4.09875,uh that's uh that's that's quite a feat to be able to do that,1,0
sw4289B-ms98-a,19,B,55.32975,59.113625,3.783875,relatively small community it uh it would be pretty easy,1,0
sw4289B-ms98-a,71,B,242.899375,250.262625,7.36325,you know used to be i guess with uh family reunions where they just sort of came in from the surrounding towns uh,1,0
sw4290A-ms98-a,22,A,142.155625,153.6835,11.527875,and no i took the door all apart again and i moved the cable over so it wasn't blocking the window but uh i don't know it used to be fun doing those sorts of things and i do- maybe i'm loosing interest or,1,0
sw4290A-ms98-a,23,A,153.6835,157.391,3.7075,also cars are getting a lot more complex than   to be ,1,0
sw4290B-ms98-a,46,B,245.127,251.501625,6.374625,-t's great uh then that's the other thing is that there always seems to be some really weird tool,1,0
sw4291A-ms98-a,17,A,92.093375,94.090375,1.997,a- be and then,1,0
sw4291A-ms98-a,19,A,98.372625,109.708375,11.33575,yeah i guess uh the location is um is something you know it's uh whether they want to be close to their family or whether you know uh farther away or something,1,0
sw4291A-ms98-a,38,A,222.325875,232.85425,10.528375,and you just you just really didn't have any you know any rights and you just just it's just really structure like that and so one of my main suggestions would be to,1,0
sw4291B-ms98-a,5,B,7.634375,21.799125,14.16475,well you know maybe how to help their their child choose a college the first thing i'd be interested in is what's the child interested in doing i mean do they have a a a major that they'd want to be interested in you know courses that they'd want to be taking um,3,0
sw4291B-ms98-a,68,B,281.934,292.01575,10.08175,at the individual needs you know i've you know there there some there some students who even as freshmen would be ready to go live in an apartment and and start cooking there own meals and everything but there some who wouldn't be,2,0
sw4292A-ms98-a,7,A,23.89575,35.1095,11.21375,that's basically the only information i have on computers  i think i'd it would be good for me to have a laptop computer f- for for college,1,0
sw4292B-ms98-a,11,B,32.416625,34.664125,2.2475,that'd be handy in college,1,0
sw4293A-ms98-a,58,A,279.771125,284.676,4.904875,and then especially if it can't be solved in a half hour with ads in between you know,1,0
sw4293B-ms98-a,2,B,0.33125,11.03425,10.703,yes uh i think a lot of the problems whether they be in school or in home in discipline has a p- it is rooted in the amount of time parents spend with their kids ,1,0
sw4293B-ms98-a,58,B,267.630625,276.9865,9.355875,yeah it's it's it's just uh parents today are it's they want everything if if it can't be done in five minutes don't bother me with it,1,0
sw4294A-ms98-a,4,A,14.964875,21.15125,6.186375,or the i guess the criminal you can't say they're criminal yet but they would be the uh the defendant,1,0
sw4294A-ms98-a,6,A,22.024125,28.934125,6.91,the accused right and if you um if you require the jury to be unanimous,1,0
sw4294A-ms98-a,7,A,28.934125,35.96875,7.034625,i'm afraid there'd there'd be a lot of there'd be a lot of cases where just a single person is being stubborn and um,2,0
sw4294B-ms98-a,14,B,90.69725,100.222125,9.524875,uh it's when uh the government decides that a certain behavior uh shall not be authorized anymore and that anybody who is then caught doing it is guilty of violating the crime,1,0
sw4294B-ms98-a,25,B,160.6,168.54675,7.94675,that that means that the other crimes are no longer a valid point of contention it's sort of like saying somebody should be able to do all the Coke they want,1,0
sw4294B-ms98-a,27,B,176.165,184.36175,8.19675,that they should be treated the same way as someone who looses control and beats someone up without being under the influence of chemicals whose they can't use it as an excuse,1,0
sw4294B-ms98-a,39,B,250.930125,256.763625,5.8335,oh the jury definitely and uh whether it's unanimous or not i think that it could be uh,1,0
sw4294B-ms98-a,40,B,256.763625,260.725,3.961375,th- there there needs to be lots of evidence for appealing um,1,0
sw4294B-ms98-a,41,B,260.725,272.245875,11.520875,i have a friend who uh took his trial by judge and that's the worst mistake anyone can ever make because at least with the jury even though you're going to be tried by six or twelve people who weren't able to get out of jury duty,1,0
sw4294B-ms98-a,45,B,284.732,292.07825,7.34625,and we have to sacrifice letting a few people get away with things because eventually they're going to be caught then,1,0
sw4295A-ms98-a,22,A,153.041,160.1635,7.1225,to be built as replacement parts for an old Westinghouse Radar Westinghouse wasn't going to support it anymore and Spencer you know Spencer Gifts,1,0
sw4295A-ms98-a,30,A,215.839625,226.45375,10.614125,yeah i really wish there was some solution to this  bureaucratic obesity that just seems to be prevalent in every sort of administration or administrative thing that gets so big ,1,0
sw4295B-ms98-a,15,B,84.532375,96.27225,11.739875,i think what we really need to do is concentrate more on reducing waste on assuring that government be efficient you know we need more programs where people get rewarded for money saving suggestions w-,1,0
sw4295B-ms98-a,28,B,206.099375,216.2585,10.159125,i don't know how much it costs them to maintain that outdated software but you'd think at some stage they'd get the get the idea that it it it pays to get to be more current,1,0
sw4295B-ms98-a,35,B,264.02075,279.0185,14.99775,uh i'm not sure that some of them shouldn't be looked at more carefully pro- uh uh and i think of of programs you know when you when uh uh like the the um aid to families with dependent children that appears to create an incentive for unmarried women to have more kids,1,0
sw4296A-ms98-a,11,A,62.499125,68.080375,5.58125,yeah i agree completely there should be a waiting period and they should be able to do a background check on you,2,0
sw4296A-ms98-a,24,A,112.169625,122.7675,10.597875,you need a permit to carry a concealed handgun i think in some states i think Texas might be one of those but to just carry you know one in the open or whatever is no problem,1,0
sw4296A-ms98-a,27,A,146.074,158.293625,12.219625,given the success or rather lack there of of the police in controlling the market in drugs i sort of wonder uh you know really how effective it would be but i don't i don't mean that,1,0
sw4296A-ms98-a,30,A,165.678125,171.65275,5.974625,something to be aware of that it probably would not be the the ultimate solution that would solve all crime problems,2,0
sw4296A-ms98-a,47,A,269.8035,283.835625,14.032125,thanks to the fact hi- his motorcycle helmet was made out of Kevlar which is the same thing that bullet proof vest are made out of and so uh you know he was shot in the head but he was unharmed you know i mean i think i think he might've gone to the hospital anyway just to you know be looked at but,1,0

sw4302A-ms98-a,14,A,43.215625,51.2255,8.009875,think is appropriate i guess there might be exceptions you know if if you're in a critical position like you're a traffic controller or something like that,1,0
sw4302A-ms98-a,40,A,146.077125,149.87875,3.801625,yeah i know think most impairments would be ob- fairly obvious you know but,1,0
sw4302A-ms98-a,58,A,234.287125,236.552625,2.2655,you know the climate would be different then,1,0
sw4302A-ms98-a,70,A,288.233375,291.51725,3.283875,it might be that they the carr- the carrier they're using has a,1,0
sw4302B-ms98-a,17,B,121.6405,131.25575,9.61525,um feasible way of going about this because you know everybody is going to be against drugs you know well just about everybody is against drug use so let's test everybody for it,1,0
sw4302B-ms98-a,30,B,207.115,220.79275,13.67775,um luckily my company is doesn't uh do any of that sort of thing they they were talking about doing the policy of testing new people new employees as they come in but not anything i- it wouldn't be random it would be everybody um,2,0
sw4302B-ms98-a,31,B,220.79275,225.512,4.71925,and it wouldn't be current employees it would only be new employees um,2,0

sw4303B-ms98-a,18,B,111.277875,123.459875,12.182,that well yes that's true but also uh we haven't learned enough about cancer to be able to prevent it but it many ways AIDS is completely preventable through uh behavioral changes,1,0
sw4303B-ms98-a,21,B,145.317625,157.02975,11.712125,if all the internal bickering between in Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health health uh over who's going to get credit for solving it were to be set aside,1,0
sw4303B-ms98-a,23,B,165.759125,175.910875,10.15175,a cure with the promise that they'd be able to get the financial rewards from it uh i feel that we'd find a cure really quick,1,0
sw4303B-ms98-a,34,B,218.71075,221.9175,3.20675,uh i do want there to be a cure,1,0
sw4303B-ms98-a,42,B,275.329625,282.630875,7.30125,and it's interesting that there are there do seem to be a lot of people who are HIV positive but who never get the disease,1,0
sw4304A-ms98-a,27,A,121.18725,133.97125,12.784,uh um it pre supposes something that isn't necessarily that isn't necessarily true first of all that you think that child care should be done by other people besides the people having the kids,1,0
sw4304A-ms98-a,33,A,153.819375,165.65525,11.835875,kind of overused in a sense it's the idea is that you can have a two income family and nothing is going to be changed you know the idea of quality time over,1,0
sw4304A-ms98-a,55,A,283.973375,290.135875,6.1625,and especially i i think it would be ultimate really impossible because she just had twins not very long ago,1,0
sw4304B-ms98-a,48,B,192.8065,204.898625,12.092125,you know you could call me a career woman but i i do feel that i want to be at home with my kids mainly because i see that as such an important thing um,1,0
sw4304B-ms98-a,52,B,215.487375,221.928875,6.4415,i mean these are human beings that we're trying to raise and help them be constructive members of society,1,0
sw4304B-ms98-a,60,B,251.707125,254.83325,3.126125,i'm sure their kids would be much better served if,1,0
sw4305B-ms98-a,28,B,185.70975,201.57125,15.8615,but uh you know i've watched this slowly erode erode erode until the point where now um i figure that the next thing is going to be uh you're going to have to pay big bucks and they're only going to pay cover certain certain uh diseases,1,0
sw4306A-ms98-a,14,A,85.1215,92.1725,7.051,so i don't quite like the idea of the in civil trials in sounds like in a lot places the jury comes up with what the award amount should be,1,0
sw4306A-ms98-a,16,A,94.057,100.15175,6.09475,another party you know the the jury just say this is the things we think money should be awarded for,1,0
sw4306A-ms98-a,17,A,100.15175,105.559375,5.407625,and then either the judge or a three judge tribunal coming up with what the award amount should be,1,0
sw4306B-ms98-a,30,B,147.034125,157.514,10.479875,eighty three million dollars or something is probably acceptive because i think what i'd really want would be someone to you know the money to take care of,1,0
sw4306B-ms98-a,47,B,249.081625,258.3425,9.260875,uh  i don't  it's a good question i guess it's off the topic we're supposed to be discussing but,1,0
sw4307A-ms98-a,6,A,30.636625,42.53425,11.897625,so i think that pretty much clearly leads me to my con- conviction that i i do not believe that uh spot drug tests or required drug tests should be should be,2,0
sw4307A-ms98-a,7,A,42.53425,46.8035,4.26925,you know mandated however they could be done with the person's consent,1,0
sw4307A-ms98-a,18,A,89.542375,96.92225,7.379875,okay  well i maybe i should qualify mine and and mention of course there are some legal parameters that need to be observed as well,1,0
sw4307A-ms98-a,30,A,227.31975,238.973375,11.653625,well uh as as far as i- i'm not sure you you sort of seem to be kind of saying that you have the right to uh pursue any kind of substance that you'd like except for in certain,1,0
sw4307B-ms98-a,7,B,72.201375,78.366125,6.16475,where they better be on top of things like running trains flying planes or uh driving buses ,1,0
sw4307B-ms98-a,13,B,131.427375,138.537875,7.1105,uh we're going to make sure that you can't get a job or that you'll be fired from your job if you are engaging in this behavior,1,0
sw4307B-ms98-a,19,B,184.942625,198.120625,13.178,and if by all standards that can be compared potential for abuse uh general impact on society physical impact on the individual this drug should not be outlawed but the right wing does not want to hear talk like that,2,0
sw4307B-ms98-a,25,B,241.492125,251.067125,9.575,i'd say it's pretty much it's uh right to privacy the individual can do whatever they want as long as they don't negatively impact other individuals it is then that negative impact that should be looked at,1,0
sw4308A-ms98-a,2,A,8.322125,19.7,11.377875,#NAME?,1,0
sw4309A-ms98-a,18,A,93.3625,101.671375,8.308875,and um  you know it'd be good to even to start as early as possible to understand what what you child would desire,1,0
sw4309A-ms98-a,27,A,143.754625,146.604125,2.8495,though it's probably more so now than used to be,1,0
sw4309A-ms98-a,29,A,151.48725,164.062125,12.574875,you know you could always shoot for those places that don't ha- you know are  that might be considered out of your range but sometimes you might be able to get a scholarship or whatever have you so i wouldn't rule them out on the first cut,2,0
sw4309A-ms98-a,32,A,178.823875,188.9925,10.168625,um you know whether a child wants to be closer or away how far away they want to be from home there's a lot of different other aspects to it you know,2,0
sw4309A-ms98-a,37,A,215.01425,224.708375,9.694125,and uh if that's what the school's doing then um it may not be around the following year especially these times ,1,0
sw4309A-ms98-a,47,A,275.455625,280.54075,5.085125,yeah they also tend not to be as well endowed and they also have ,1,0

sw4310B-ms98-a,36,B,157.720625,163.94375,6.223125,um if uh you know we we say the president can be limited to two terms and we don't limit,1,0
sw4311A-ms98-a,8,A,42.3665,46.994875,4.628375,well i guess if i were going to choose i mean my first consideration would be safety,1,0
sw4311A-ms98-a,9,A,46.994875,49.957125,2.96225, my second consideration would be uh,1,0
sw4311A-ms98-a,12,A,53.714875,57.4575,3.742625,and uh i guess my third consideration would be uh,1,0
sw4311A-ms98-a,19,A,136.70475,148.128875,11.424125,judge uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are,2,0
sw4311A-ms98-a,34,A,258.66125,271.203,12.54175,from instit- from uh industrial uh base to uh information base and so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work,1,0
sw4311B-ms98-a,6,B,21.496625,34.12275,12.626125,i do have some thoughts on that yeah and it's uh an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for or a parent for a lot of people there,1,0
sw4311B-ms98-a,28,B,208.19075,210.24675,2.056,that would be lovely,1,0
sw4311B-ms98-a,34,B,242.775375,248.153375,5.378,that would be okay  that would that would help on the other end too,1,0
sw4311B-ms98-a,35,B,248.153375,254.08725,5.933875,in in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be,2,0

sw4313A-ms98-a,20,A,92.619125,97.70275,5.083625,um there seems to be some spectacular progress happening there and uh,1,0
sw4313A-ms98-a,22,A,108.032375,112.850125,4.81775,well what would be what would be the reasons for prohibiting commercial research,2,0
sw4313A-ms98-a,44,A,229.74,231.44675,1.70675,it may be obsolete,1,0
sw4313A-ms98-a,47,A,239.46175,244.50975,5.048,um i think that the way things are going on now may be an impediment and th- by that i mean ,1,0
sw4313A-ms98-a,51,A,258.51575,262.0385,3.52275,but it's going to be a real long term uh play,1,0
sw4313A-ms98-a,56,A,287.070625,296.428125,9.3575,uh with regard to myself personally i think that if ever if i ever in my lifetime do stand on the surface of the moon it's going to be uh on a ship with a Japanese flag,1,0
sw4313B-ms98-a,26,B,121.677125,129.051625,7.3745,uh i mean  and besides the fact it it also would be extremely limiting as to which research it'd be be whichever one happened to bring in the dollar,3,0
sw4313B-ms98-a,30,B,152.599375,162.61775,10.018375,the amount of money uh put towards research is is minuscule and had minuscule and has been decreasing over the last few years th- so i'm not so sure that that would be,1,0
sw4313B-ms98-a,31,B,162.61775,175.244,12.62625,i- i- i agree that the bureaucracy in most cases is something  it should be avoided and we have we have entirely too much government and bureaucracy and it and it seeps over in a lot of different ways,1,0
sw4313B-ms98-a,34,B,189.094875,198.2265,9.131625,oh well be- i mean we have um resources across the world i mean i- i we're coming out to a global global economy anyways,1,0
sw4314A-ms98-a,43,A,142.604125,154.01475,11.410625,oh that's fantastic yeah i used to uh kind of be that way myself when i lived in in northwestern Florida in the panhandle i used to sail about everyday i'd wor- go to work,1,0
sw4314B-ms98-a,54,B,217.177,219.2025,2.0255,that that'd be something,1,0
sw4315A-ms98-a,54,A,205.403125,210.30325,4.900125,right and if he had succeeded uh uh without a doubt he should be e- executed,1,0
sw4315A-ms98-a,70,A,289.579625,297.849625,8.27,yeah i think that's a a case where there really needs to be some change in the laws to allow for flexibility i think if one person kills another person out of,1,0
sw4316A-ms98-a,32,A,207.301375,215.883,8.581625,but getting i mean  well see i always have problems because because i can never decide whether or not i'm i'm supposed to be a conservative or or a liberal but,1,0
sw4316A-ms98-a,34,A,217.432,221.75175,4.31975,i keep thinking that there's got to be some way that that a lot of this is,1,0
sw4316A-ms98-a,35,A,221.75175,232.6485,10.89675,circumstances i mean i can't help but wonder if if i grew up without a father on the streets and with like little or no money wouldn't wouldn't i be in prison at this point or another,1,0
sw4316B-ms98-a,4,B,6.6455,14.5735,7.928,uh well uh out of control i don't know  i guess it could be worse um  we've uh,1,0

sw4317B-ms98-a,37,B,177.01425,180.46375,3.4495,i think they might be a little bit more hard to handle too,1,0
sw4317B-ms98-a,48,B,226.466125,231.036375,4.57025,we drove we drove through there and looked that looks like it'd be beautiful out there,1,0
sw4318A-ms98-a,59,A,295.960125,298.626,2.665875,i don't know if if uh i- it seems to be,1,0
sw4318B-ms98-a,14,B,58.290375,71.707125,13.41675,you know buy American keep American auto workers working right now but i feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while if i were to buy another car i would be uh,1,0
sw4318B-ms98-a,15,B,71.707125,83.482875,11.77575,i would be partial to buying another Japanese car but i would also look at American cars but when i bought the car that i bought now i did that also and i just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product so if i were,1,0
sw4318B-ms98-a,19,B,92.205875,97.74425,5.538375,right it is um i'm kind of right now the next car i buy is gonna be,1,0
sw4318B-ms98-a,53,B,220.9095,226.172875,5.263375,so i guess you'd have to say if i was looking i would definitely be looking for a foreign car,1,0
sw4319A-ms98-a,46,A,191.695375,202.4835,10.788125,and uh  so i i think i'm actually involved in a relatively good p- plan at this point um but uh it could be better that's for sure and,1,0

sw4321B-ms98-a,20,B,64.68925,66.45025,1.761,might be acceptable,1,0
sw4321B-ms98-a,23,B,73.959,79.235,5.276,but in civil cases i think a majority rule by by jury would be be sufficient,2,0

sw4322A-ms98-a,31,A,171.429375,181.569375,10.14,that's an awful lot to to bring into a program you got to have eight million jobs available you've got to have administrators for eight million jobs that would be tremendously expensive,1,0
sw4322A-ms98-a,33,A,191.540625,204.05225,12.511625,enterprises for for for a couple of years uh that's going to delay their entry into the work force delay the time when they can begin paying taxes too so so the impact is going to be double there i um,1,0
sw4322A-ms98-a,42,A,238.941125,251.07125,12.130125,you just need a program for the people that haven't gotten anythi- gotten anything better to do and i think that might be a good idea although again then you get the kind of people who are likely to sell drugs to their coworkers et cetera,1,0
sw4322B-ms98-a,7,B,16.94275,25.35425,8.4115,you know meshes with how they feel and what they're good at and they shouldn't be funneled into a mandatory sort of a thing,1,0

sw4322B-ms98-a,14,B,85.278625,93.9955,8.716875,of course the program would have to work or else they'll think yeah public service another boondoggle you know they'll be sitting there working on the job doing nothing,1,0
sw4322B-ms98-a,19,B,128.473375,137.517875,9.0445,they think they're going to be saving lots of money on repainting and having the car last that much longer no because they want it to look really sharp,1,0

sw4326A-ms98-a,8,A,77.594,83.344375,5.750375,the defense and military you know any any application like that i think it should be mandatory,1,0

sw4326A-ms98-a,46,A,243.9635,249.154125,5.190625,just routine jobs that people should be subject to that kind of invasion of privacy,1,0
sw4326A-ms98-a,56,A,286.57325,294.804875,8.231625,uh that the police should be one of those public uh safety issues where you know  drug testing where it would be favorable,2,0
sw4326B-ms98-a,11,B,46.227125,52.97375,6.746625,that um people can be screened for uh should be screens for uh for drugs through uh drug testing,2,0
sw4326B-ms98-a,24,B,137.5025,143.409,5.9065,but my concern is and i think that that that what needs to be further investigated,1,0
sw4326B-ms98-a,36,B,210.043625,216.402125,6.3585,you can be reduced in rank forfeit your pay or if it's a repeat repeat o- uh offense,1,0
sw4326B-ms98-a,42,B,232.308375,238.73875,6.430375,so i- i think you got to be careful with stuff like that that's that's my only concern about the whole issue i think,1,0
sw4327A-ms98-a,13,A,84.078,93.174375,9.096375,because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures they know what's good and what isn't they'd be able to say i'm sorry you can't,1,0
sw4327A-ms98-a,17,A,116.394125,118.737875,2.34375, that may very well be,1,0
sw4327B-ms98-a,17,B,135.973,148.967625,12.994625,we have work schedules we can be called at work we have Social Security numbers they can trace us down we have telephones and we have checkbooks criminals have none of these things they're real difficult to catch and if they do catch them,1,0
sw4329B-ms98-a,18,B,51.174375,57.20625,6.031875,and you set it out and they pick it up and i- it works real neat they seem to be having a real good response,1,0
sw4329B-ms98-a,57,B,199.501625,205.96525,6.463625,yeah it's i don't know it it can be it's not as easy ,1,0
sw4330A-ms98-a,20,A,201.395625,211.45475,10.059125,you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing i think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident,1,0
sw4330B-ms98-a,35,B,232.75325,241.945375,9.192125,you know they're they should be able to make it as a condition of employment in some sense and you know it's like you're i mean employments are contractual by nature anyway,1,0
sw4330B-ms98-a,38,B,257.071125,271.7455,14.674375,um going in uh before any of these interviews i'm not even working for this company i'm going in for like interviews and they flew me out to Chicago and and uh before i went in to any of the interviews uh they took me to the doctor to give me a physical they said it was going to be a physical you know,1,0
sw4331A-ms98-a,3,A,11.007375,16.0415,5.034125,well uh do you think it should just be restricted to certain crimes,1,0
sw4331A-ms98-a,30,A,159.003,163.90525,4.90225,i think so but maybe not maybe not i could be confused what do i know ,1,0
sw4331B-ms98-a,23,B,96.184625,109.08525,12.900625,i don't know how we rank up there with the other states but uh i think it's a deterrent i- i don't i mean it wouldn't be a deterrent for everybody obviously but i think uh if it uh,1,0
sw4331B-ms98-a,24,B,109.08525,122.849,13.76375,if it saves one person's life it may be worth it uh if one person who was going to kill somebody thought otherwise because of the uh possibility or a possibility of capital punishment it uh it may be worth it,2,0
sw4331B-ms98-a,47,B,208.994625,217.8435,8.848875,but what gets me is the uh i may be getting off the subject somebody might get forty five years for stealing i mean for robbing something,1,0
sw4331B-ms98-a,48,B,217.8435,224.506875,6.663375,of course that i think to get that they'd have to be a repeat offender that'd be more than one or two cases involved,2,0
sw4331B-ms98-a,49,B,224.506875,230.16625,5.659375,but the the whole judicial system seems to be lopsided messed up,1,0
sw4331B-ms98-a,52,B,238.492,245.29075,6.79875,no murder and again rape possibly a repeated uh rapist may be uh,1,0
sw4332A-ms98-a,8,A,21.727375,29.834625,8.10725,uh i suppose a reasonable default on um issues the moral issue would be just let everybody live and not,1,0
sw4332A-ms98-a,10,A,36.892875,45.78,8.887125,now you have to care for somebody that you otherwise wouldn't have to i suppose that might actually be a uh pretty rude way of rude way of looking at it though,1,0
sw4332A-ms98-a,27,A,136.61025,138.183,1.57275,shouldn't be using it,1,0
sw4332A-ms98-a,29,A,140.24575,146.2575,6.01175,there's a lot of can'ts and shouldn'ts and don'ts and stuff that seem to be pretty well ignored these days,1,0
sw4332A-ms98-a,61,A,264.978875,269.759875,4.781,they're they're often does seem to be backlash against light things,1,0
sw4332B-ms98-a,11,B,124.278625,130.865875,6.58725,and if it's if it's not acceptable to ever make a mistake you know ever sentence somebody to death that shouldn't be,1,0
sw4333A-ms98-a,6,A,51.4225,64.12475,12.70225,for instance like Social Security tax or Soc- uh i mean that's that's tax we're paying money and and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us,1,0
sw4333A-ms98-a,11,A,94.111375,106.858875,12.7475,which i may be wrong but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded but but supposedly once you have an office in DC or you know and and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down and and they just haven't yet,1,0
sw4333A-ms98-a,15,A,119.4185,126.025125,6.606625,well that might be the difference i don't know uh the other thing that uh i remember seeing on TV lately is uh had to do with,1,0
sw4333A-ms98-a,22,A,174.01375,180.03425,6.0205,so it sounds like you uh you think that that we'd be able to save some money by uh passing the line item veto,1,0
sw4333B-ms98-a,4,B,13.865625,25.654,11.788375, i let's example uh o- our friend the President right now says no new taxes we should and especially if anything be cutting taxes now because of the recession and at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has,1,0
sw4333B-ms98-a,24,B,207.48725,216.9425,9.45525, there's always going to be a dispute as to uh where the exa- where the boundary between waste and and necessity is,1,0
sw4333B-ms98-a,26,B,227.829,237.45875,9.62975,uh pork barrel politics the- the- there has to be some way to do it i know state governors usually have line item vetos and uh,1,0
sw4334B-ms98-a,43,B,178.0735,185.86425,7.79075,it doesn't have to be good it's just who does it you know you hear a you hear a Paula Abdul song and you and i think if somebody else were to play that ,1,0
sw4334B-ms98-a,44,B,185.86425,194.124125,8.259875,you know they wouldn't they nobody everybody would think that's lousy but because she did it it's supposed to be good you know it comes to the point where it's your name not what you do,1,0
sw4334B-ms98-a,45,B,194.124125,198.750875,4.62675,more than anything Madonna can do anything and it would be considered good because it's Madonna you know,1,0
sw4334B-ms98-a,46,B,198.750875,206.847375,8.0965,Madonna could start playing folk music and folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it so it's it's it's really backwards how things are working now but,1,0
sw4335A-ms98-a,30,A,103.63925,110.82475,7.1855,well they might be i haven't really heard  who they been uh trading or anything but uh,1,0
sw4335A-ms98-a,31,A,110.82475,119.99275,9.168,they're usually pretty good right up near the top and so are the Raiders so it's gonna be tough they always have a tough time with the Raiders so,1,0
sw4335A-ms98-a,43,A,170.588375,176.16725,5.578875,yeah he's on defensive he's supposed to be pretty good though so,1,0
sw4335B-ms98-a,15,B,65.654875,72.466875,6.812,oh yeah they're all they're all huge guys i mean a small guy would be about six three and,1,0

sw4336A-ms98-a,29,A,230.488375,243.390875,12.9025,the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in but even so it i mean it's it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to to like lock the doors when they go out  you know and things like that,1,0
sw4336A-ms98-a,30,A,243.390875,254.392375,11.0015,uh i- it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when people are here when they're not just come in,1,0
sw4336B-ms98-a,40,B,266.718625,272.697,5.978375,yeah that's true but you be surprised also how  much people watch you that even uh,1,0
sw4336B-ms98-a,43,B,294.636875,298.85,4.213125,uh you must don't have to be to work at eight you know like shock,1,0
sw4337A-ms98-a,5,A,21.647625,24.888375,3.24075,nothing in our world seems to be by unanimous vote,1,0
sw4337A-ms98-a,18,A,126.36,132.318625,5.958625,you know i i wouldn't couldn't tell you if we sentenced someone tomorrow how long he'd actually be in jail,1,0
sw4337A-ms98-a,27,A,164.39825,168.2185,3.82025,definitely would but i see where they would be experts,1,0
sw4337A-ms98-a,45,A,249.624625,258.389,8.764375,that's true i think a good start would be maybe some uh simple basic education into how the process really works for  children,1,0
sw4337B-ms98-a,63,B,226.81175,235.703875,8.892125,wanna protect against that so i think the danger is less today would be less of a risk of you know uh corrupt judges and the government forcing,1,0
sw4337B-ms98-a,65,B,236.931625,250.481125,13.5495,you know someone to to be guilty for uh even though they're not or vice versa you know um but it's definitely something that would have to be watched very  if they decided to do it that way,2,0
sw4338B-ms98-a,11,B,69.961,83.989,14.028,uh we have a uh almost one he he'll be one on on April second you can hear him and the one is four and he's off taking a bath  so uh yeah we've got two kids and uh,1,0
sw4339A-ms98-a,23,A,63.54175,72.037375,8.495625,well i think the next car we get will probably be a  well i- i like Buicks we have a Buick Century now it's a nineteen eighty seven,1,0
sw4339A-ms98-a,29,A,108.74725,118.859625,10.112375,right now we've got a V-6 in it and that seems to be just fine i know they s- they're coming out with some V-8s now and i think that's probably a little overkill for this day and age,1,0
sw4339A-ms98-a,38,A,158.542625,170.59525,12.052625,traction uh not really um you know it's a two wheel drive truck and i figure if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive i probably ought to be home anyway ,1,0
sw4339A-ms98-a,56,A,242.28,255.41125,13.13125,be even handier so i know if we were if we had kids still at home we're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value,1,0
sw4339A-ms98-a,58,A,263.766125,270.910375,7.14425,uh what about uh all wheel drive is that something that you'd be interested in or is that a not an issue,1,0
sw4339B-ms98-a,5,B,23.4715,30.4995,7.028,and the car i get to drive is a uh Nissan Sentra that's gonna be ten years old next month so,1,0
sw4339B-ms98-a,20,B,125.75825,131.854375,6.096125,you know V-8s seem to be a return of the days of you know ten or twelve miles a gallon,1,0
sw4339B-ms98-a,39,B,255.347625,264.998125,9.6505,yeah i think that we're gonna be uh owning a mini van for some years to come probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway,1,0
sw4339B-ms98-a,41,B,268.977125,276.28275,7.305625,uh  i'd be satisfied with a a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra,1,0
sw4339B-ms98-a,42,B,276.28275,290.19125,13.9085,and even as as light as that is with uh the small tires it's it's done pretty well in winter uh again like you if conditions are are that bad i probably don't wanna be driving anyway,1,0
sw4339B-ms98-a,43,B,290.19125,298.466,8.27475,so i know i'd be happy with a a reasonable uh four door you know again we've we've got the same issue with getting kids into the,1,0
sw4340A-ms98-a,50,A,252.42025,258.483875,6.063625,i mean they can be but usually they aren't they're spur of the moment and uh,1,0
sw4340B-ms98-a,49,B,234.981375,243.729875,8.7485,and they are the kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that i don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead but i g- y- y- you might be able to uh stop people,1,0
sw4341A-ms98-a,2,A,6.997125,15.3835,8.386375,uh it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime but i don't think that it really actually does that i don't think it deters anybody because ,1,0
sw4341A-ms98-a,16,A,71.409125,75.467625,4.0585,needs to be punished or uh eliminated from society,1,0
sw4341A-ms98-a,29,A,139.975,151.50025,11.52525,um-hum huh do you think they should be punished at all or uh  like go to prison uh because they're not really a danger to society it was almost really self defense isn't it in a case like that,1,0
sw4341A-ms98-a,39,A,177.67025,192.50275,14.8325,um um-hum you know now i wonder what you think about this and uh unfortunately we we don't get to do it but uh it used to be a long time ago i guess in Biblical times  when they had punishment,1,0
sw4341B-ms98-a,24,B,223.392125,231.379125,7.987,well i think that would be kind of drastic punishment,1,0
sw4341B-ms98-a,29,B,241.998875,247.38,5.381125,then that chance sh- should be investigated,1,0
sw4341B-ms98-a,31,B,253.365625,261.999125,8.6335,going to murder people no matter what then i think they should be eliminated from society,1,0
sw4342A-ms98-a,8,A,34.064125,47.815625,13.7515,they have KCRW which i i- i saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable TV outlet i guess they're getting a little getting a little feisty now ,1,0
sw4342A-ms98-a,25,A,88.14725,91.07325,2.926,well that must be pretty bad ,1,0
sw4342A-ms98-a,43,A,141.769125,152.377375,10.60825,yeah pretty much um there used to be in fact i think there still is the uh the Daily News which runs out of the San Fernando Valley,1,0
sw4343A-ms98-a,3,A,24.38625,37.2065,12.82025,i think that uh uh we should be emphasizing uh things like more like education and less on on programs which are permanent black holes which will never,1,0
sw4343A-ms98-a,4,A,37.2065,41.741375,4.534875,do anything but continue to be uh uh,1,0
sw4343A-ms98-a,39,A,251.5635,259.611625,8.048125,you very seldom a- a- a- able to do anything that's strong on either side whether it be left or right,1,0
sw4343A-ms98-a,43,A,270.3315,273.209625,2.878125,it would be better than what we do now,1,0
sw4343B-ms98-a,22,B,132.243,143.59925,11.35625,there is going to be someone who will abuse it they will find a way people are very creative especially those that are on the public dole and want to be there,2,0
sw4343B-ms98-a,23,B,143.59925,153.350875,9.751625,uh they can be very creative in their in their abuses and not surprisingly some of the worst offenders are the people who are inside the system,1,0
sw4343B-ms98-a,24,B,153.350875,159.7065,6.355625,and are in a position to know exactly where the red flags would be what they can get away with,1,0
sw4343B-ms98-a,33,B,212.659625,224.02975,11.370125,to the common person national health care uh education systems that you know that's one of mine own pet peeves is how can how can our teachers be so damn efficient,1,0
sw4343B-ms98-a,34,B,224.02975,234.565875,10.536125,that they  teach our students in a hundred and eighty days what it takes Europe two hundred and forty days to teach you know how can they be that good come on  come on,1,0
sw4344A-ms98-a,17,A,58.204875,61.390375,3.1855,yeah they they tend to be pretty expensive,1,0
sw4344A-ms98-a,64,A,230.3935,236.877,6.4835,um-hum more of a classic look yeah see that doesn't have to be uncomfortable,1,0
sw4344A-ms98-a,66,A,237.99225,242.427,4.43475,yeah but you're right i think those things tend to be more expensive,1,0
sw4344A-ms98-a,74,A,270.28525,280.375125,10.089875,right yeah and since i'm a student i never buy fad clothes because_1 i know they'll be out of style the next season and then i have to go buy more  so i just don't buy any,1,0
sw4344B-ms98-a,28,B,95.53925,103.97,8.43075,yeah they seem to all be all the uniforms even like in the fast food and everything i mean they're the it's just different colors it seems like,1,0
sw4344B-ms98-a,65,B,246.772875,256.707875,9.935,um even if i'm not working that i can wear or else that i know will last you know not just for this year it'll be out of style or something and,1,0
sw4345A-ms98-a,22,A,183.329625,192.432875,9.10325,oh i like the straight reporting um and then i- i hope to be able to form my own opinion of it it's it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it,1,0
sw4345B-ms98-a,37,B,174.924125,183.18575,8.261625,which approach do you find to be um more useful the the interpretive approach or the straight reporting,1,0
sw4346B-ms98-a,22,B,144.652125,157.894375,13.24225,of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools,1,0
sw4347A-ms98-a,15,A,58.7015,73.458125,14.756625,right i was reading something in uh Consumer Reports tonight about that as a matter of fact they were talking about cars uh the car issue just came out and about how yeah you'd like to buy an American car maybe but uh you know the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever,1,0
sw4347A-ms98-a,25,A,148.72175,158.614875,9.893125,yeah that's just it technology that that comes in right now is is probably not going to be imple- implemented until you know quite a few years down the road but uh,1,0
sw4347A-ms98-a,55,A,295.194875,300.77,5.575125,okay w- w- what baud rate do you get well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred baud,1,0
sw4348A-ms98-a,4,A,8.11625,16.765125,8.648875,for former right right w- we can say the the the the soon to be former uh Commonwealth of Independent States instead is that,1,0
sw4348A-ms98-a,7,A,23.251625,32.030375,8.77875,i- i don't consider them_1 so much to be a threat anymore in terms of them using it is that we're already starting to see demonstrated that in a very cash starved country,1,0
sw4348A-ms98-a,8,A,32.030375,39.17225,7.141875,you know those things equal a commodity that can be sold to people who i i worry a lot more  than the Soviet Union,1,0
sw4348A-ms98-a,14,A,75.27375,87.187875,11.914125,right i- i think actually you know the the except for the fact that we happen to be due west of them and we got a fallout cloud i don't think the the the probability that we're gonna be involved in the first strike or anything is fair- is fairly high,2,0
sw4348A-ms98-a,28,A,165.946375,172.233875,6.2875,right you know the o- the other possible scenario of course is that in in i- it's gonna be hard for the entire,1,0
sw4348A-ms98-a,30,A,182.713125,196.304875,13.59175,the only thing i think what we have got going for us is we have a very large stick in the form of economic aid and technological aid and a lot of the Republic seem to be more interested in getting the aid in than having the nuclear weapons,1,0
sw4348A-ms98-a,35,A,217.9375,229.6515,11.714,i think inherently our the the chance that we're gonna be involved in it in anything is fairly low i think none of them are foolish enough to wanna attack the United States,1,0
sw4348A-ms98-a,39,A,260.952625,268.262875,7.31025,um-hum so you know i- i think it it's more gonna be i don't think we're looking at  uh potential for anything large scale,1,0
sw4348A-ms98-a,42,A,289.3415,298.562,9.2205,yeah i- i think that there's there are people in government who perc- who would whose job it is to make sure that we still perceive a threat where there may not be one anymore,1,0
sw4348B-ms98-a,5,B,15.216125,23.994375,8.77825,that that's true too on that one well i- i- i personally still view them to be a threat as long as they've got nuclear weapons and or other weapons that can hit us,1,0
sw4348B-ms98-a,9,B,47.953375,58.9765,11.023125,that that part is very true there's also the uh the problem of you know the scientist that will you know need money also and and they can be very rich by,1,0
sw4348B-ms98-a,15,B,110.676125,119.48925,8.813125,sure a- another problem that would worry me somewhat uh would be that say they were using nuclear weapons on themselves you know in another area,1,0
sw4349A-ms98-a,14,A,52.303625,66.667125,14.3635,i do have the background i know what needs to be done and i know the the oil needs t- should be changed re- very regularly and all of the bearings and and and the lubri- lubrication system needs to kee- be lubricated and,3,0
sw4350A-ms98-a,2,A,8.67025,21.95375,13.2835,health benefits things like uh insurance for number one but another would be like um  facilities or the ease some easy way to go out and exercise or something like that if you felt like it in the middle the day ,1,0
sw4350A-ms98-a,12,A,57.72575,62.60975,4.884,another one i'd like to see would be in flexible scheduling of hours,1,0
sw4350A-ms98-a,26,A,105.024,107.265375,2.241375,yeah that can be rough,1,0
sw4350A-ms98-a,29,A,114.765625,123.32,8.554375,i think another thing um would be nice i guess this is more of an overall really nebulous kind of thing would be consideration of,2,0
sw4350A-ms98-a,31,A,129.862625,136.625125,6.7625,um well an example would be in the military they give a whole lot of allowances for family people they even get paid more,1,0
sw4350A-ms98-a,33,A,139.251375,148.225,8.973625,um you know have being married or having children i don't really think that that is fair i think uh equal work equal pay for equal work ought to be applied in that case,1,0
sw4350A-ms98-a,39,A,182.736625,185.61525,2.878625,some kind of consideration there would be nice as well,1,0
sw4350A-ms98-a,40,A,185.61525,188.890375,3.275125,i don't know what would be the solution i suppose uh,1,0
sw4350A-ms98-a,51,A,232.17225,236.668625,4.496375,no i'm gonna be thirty this year but ,1,0
sw4350B-ms98-a,5,B,33.543125,39.698,6.154875,but as far as what i'd really like to see is i live close enough to the city that i would be able to bicycle in if i could,1,0
sw4350B-ms98-a,9,B,52.255875,54.0415,1.785625,that would be something to look forward to,1,0
sw4350B-ms98-a,21,B,86.4645,88.47875,2.01425,yeah that would be nice,1,0
sw4350B-ms98-a,67,B,291.602875,293.50025,1.897375,so that'll be at three sixty a year,1,0
sw4351A-ms98-a,6,A,32.515125,42.13325,9.618125,so we were constantly expected to exercise and be in shape and then we had specific standards we had to meet based on our age group,1,0
sw4352A-ms98-a,16,A,96.7865,107.821875,11.035375,you know moving stuff around which i find myself doing fair amounts since i tend to sort of move  twice a year at this point um that kind of th- thing would be very handy um ,1,0
sw4352A-ms98-a,18,A,117.06925,122.155875,5.086625,you know be something that was rated fairly good for reliability um,1,0
sw4352A-ms98-a,26,A,173.983625,182.408125,8.4245,you know say a a you know five year old car um gi- with for given amount of mileage the Japanese car'll be,1,0
sw4352A-ms98-a,27,A,182.408125,191.484625,9.0765,going for a lot more money generally yeah and especially this one thing i was kind of appalled at is people would be selling uh,1,0
sw4352A-ms98-a,28,A,191.484625,203.7835,12.298875,Japanese cars for you know that had say a hundred thousand miles on them and they'd be asking for a lot of money for them like not much less money than i found say the equivalent Japanese car for with fifty thousand miles on it or something,1,0
sw4352A-ms98-a,30,A,208.1235,212.822125,4.698625,i mean i have to be a little bit skeptical i mean maybe it's true but hm,1,0
sw4352A-ms98-a,50,A,276.623875,288.704625,12.08075,in in under like circumstances you know i guess would it'd be while the car was running and maybe some you know certain speeds or whatever that it could cause the uh cause fairly serious engine damage,1,0
sw4352A-ms98-a,51,A,288.704625,292.29075,3.586125,i could be wrong about that it is something i just vaguely remember hearing,1,0
sw4352A-ms98-a,52,A,292.29075,298.85,6.55925,um yeah but i- i could be wrong about that but yeah i mean i would say in general you know probably although it's,1,0
sw4353B-ms98-a,8,B,40.056875,44.805125,4.74825,so i have to be that's that's kind of the way i feel about it you know,1,0
sw4353B-ms98-a,63,B,288.870625,298.306,9.435375,and it would be very hard for me because i wouldn't have i wouldn't have any idea of how much money i was spending in one month now i have know exactly what i'm spending and it is so much,1,0
sw4354A-ms98-a,5,A,24.038625,32.869375,8.83075,um-hum yeah i think i'd be be somewhere around a four or five myself and yeah it  it seems to me like there's there's,2,0
sw4354A-ms98-a,12,A,79.375,84.945375,5.570375,and if you did it really wouldn't be worth eating so  you know,1,0
sw4354A-ms98-a,19,A,123.4635,127.922375,4.458875,a- and usually if you're gonna go hunting it's pretty early in the morning anyway and the store is not gonna be open so,1,0
sw4354A-ms98-a,26,A,188.285,198.8705,10.5855,i guess i mean the only thing that i worr- i question is i mean i think if if it was really easy to enforce that it it would be great the only thing that uh that would worry me about it,1,0
sw4354A-ms98-a,29,A,216.4215,226.5575,10.136,so i mean they're not they're not even staying in prison without the extra years on there much less i don't think they'd be staying any longer with extra years tagged on there,1,0
sw4354A-ms98-a,31,A,252.9825,262.01475,9.03225,um-hum i think you might've had the i- i guess i mean i'm that's got to be part of gun control but i like the idea of the uh the waiting period because,1,0
sw4354B-ms98-a,48,B,239.280375,253.629875,14.3495,i personally my personal belief is you know as you commit a crime you know you should be punished and and  and if you know you are not going to get punished or very little punishment then there's no reason not to,1,0
sw4355A-ms98-a,61,A,253.180125,264.481625,11.3015,they're pe- the drug makers the illegal drug makers are experimenting with more dangerous variations of what use to be very harmless drugs,1,0
sw4355B-ms98-a,25,B,75.886125,81.270125,5.384,you know a certain amount of testing should be done or in the field of a doctor or something like that,1,0
sw4355B-ms98-a,49,B,176.154,182.214875,6.060875,is it a pretty lar- so it must be a pretty large percentage still that experiment with drugs right,1,0
sw4356A-ms98-a,32,A,157.84575,165.54325,7.6975,one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety one Ford Taurus because_1 they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags,1,0
sw4356B-ms98-a,4,B,5.983125,18.10475,12.121625,a lot about them_1 i haven't been over uh to a dealer to look at them_1 although i did see something in tonight's paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the i guess the Japanese cars,1,0
sw4356B-ms98-a,14,B,50.499875,53.76625,3.266375,desires tend to be pretty picky and so uh,1,0
sw4356B-ms98-a,62,B,234.5475,237.814375,3.266875,those are yeah that that'd be a good deal to go with,1,0
sw4357A-ms98-a,18,A,80.605875,85.168375,4.5625,yeah my grandpa lived to be ninety four and,1,0
sw4357A-ms98-a,30,A,155.7975,158.741625,2.944125,still it was nice to be with her and stuff,1,0
sw4357A-ms98-a,57,A,273.6975,287.459875,13.762375, that and you know a lot of people say it's good for the elderly because they can be with you know people with their same interest and their same age and stuff but i don't know i i would never want to be in a rest home,2,0
sw4358A-ms98-a,8,A,55.88575,67.32075,11.435,i i know a lot i think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort ,1,0
sw4358A-ms98-a,12,A,96.25525,99.468125,3.212875,but uh people need to be more conscious of it,1,0
sw4358A-ms98-a,14,A,117.115875,130.37775,13.261875,yeah  no it it didn't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans um and and matter of fact i think it took like three tries t- for it to go through ,1,0
sw4358A-ms98-a,22,A,182.21575,189.091375,6.875625,th- there definitely has to be a motivation factor and i know that at wh- where i work i work for a defense contractor,1,0
sw4358A-ms98-a,25,A,207.18425,220.52,13.33575,uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh you know uh uh china wear rather than uh styrofoam stuff so so i- i- it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it i think that's that's what they need to do be more proactive like that ,1,0
sw4358B-ms98-a,22,B,284.034375,289.283625,5.24925,uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them,1,0
sw4359B-ms98-a,30,B,102.258375,109.094375,6.836,i mean i- i want him to be i want him to be stimulated and interested,2,0
sw4360A-ms98-a,41,A,134.096375,141.9755,7.879125,and that um usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home,1,0
sw4361A-ms98-a,27,A,73.726125,78.350625,4.6245, i'd be surprised if we're getting something that was ten times as good as what you're getting,1,0
sw4361A-ms98-a,32,A,90.34625,101.584,11.23775,you know being able to buy a new set of books or a new piece of equipment may be valuable by and large that correlation between the amount of money you shovel in and the quality of education doesn't seem to be that strong,2,0
sw4361A-ms98-a,40,A,134.326625,141.94175,7.615125,thing is there are nonfinancial there there should be nonfinancial benefits to teaching that i think we've managed to squash out of the system,1,0
sw4361A-ms98-a,41,A,141.94175,149.98575,8.044,um it used to be thirty years ago being a teacher was a uh position of respect you were educating the young,1,0
sw4361A-ms98-a,49,A,185.97825,194.26425,8.286,uh whatever the nature of the reform is the administration of the reform will be captured by the union and rendered ineffective ,1,0
sw4361A-ms98-a,60,A,248.775375,255.322375,6.547,the youth of the country to be uh mature productive responsible citizens is potentially a uh,1,0
sw4361A-ms98-a,62,A,258.461375,271.53525,13.073875,um it's potentially a very re- not rewarding but uh it should be a respected profession so the question about asking is not why does no  why isn't it but well it should be what's preventing it from being respected,2,0
sw4362B-ms98-a,1,B,0,8.330375,8.330375, uh well  uh having sort of recently gone through the school system i seem to be younger than most people who who talk on this thing i'm i'm just graduating coll-,1,0
sw4362B-ms98-a,4,B,26.206125,34.56325,8.357125, um it seems to be not difficult enough for students not challenging enough and just not generally competitive enough,1,0
sw4362B-ms98-a,19,B,119.023875,130.603,11.579125, uh well i- i don't pretend to understand that either uh but i'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools but then again i'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put,2,0
sw4362B-ms98-a,23,B,153.610125,166.314375,12.70425,that things ought to get better so uh a- the other two a- oh they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in anyways and clearly to me is a kind of government thing to,1,0
sw4362B-ms98-a,39,B,284.12,297.186,13.066,uh paid that perhaps that might be one area that that could be improved uh wh- you have other professional jobs and thi- this is a profession and as a matter of fact it's a pretty big influence on on,2,0
sw4363A-ms98-a,17,A,51.529875,60.245875,8.716,yeah to be honest with you i- i probably watch uh college a little bit more than i do pro yeah i kind of like college actually quite a bit,1,0
sw4363A-ms98-a,23,A,73.09525,74.964625,1.869375,yeah yeah that could be,1,0
sw4363A-ms98-a,33,A,97.85025,107.21475,9.3645,yeah well i can see i can see definitely how you could get into that i to be honest with you i find that that too much running gets pretty boring as well and,1,0
sw4363B-ms98-a,4,B,11.14475,23.173375,12.028625,yeah that's my favorite team so uh now Randall's coming back next season i hope they'll be do a little bit better they didn't do too bad last season but i hope they can do better how about yourself,1,0
sw4363B-ms98-a,29,B,148.741375,154.627125,5.88575,something to take over major league baseball it's just i just you know i mean it it it can be,1,0
sw4363B-ms98-a,30,B,154.627125,159.03525,4.408125,it can take over part of it but it's never gonna be the next,1,0
sw4363B-ms98-a,31,B,159.03525,171.16875,12.1335,yeah it's yeah it's gonna take a little bit some people are gonna watch it but it's not gonna be wide spread Super Bowl and every Sunday m- afternoon or anything you know it's just it's never gonna reach that that standard but,1,0
sw4363B-ms98-a,45,B,221.705,234.130125,12.425125,so yeah i could see the feel for that but it's it's pretty it's fun to play i'll give it that it is fun to play if you don't value your body very much but you know uh i don't think rugby will ever be professional but,1,0
sw4364A-ms98-a,34,A,247.906875,261.615125,13.70825,and they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that and they say oh we we know you you uh had uh contributed X amount last year can you do better this year,1,0
sw4364B-ms98-a,4,B,6.382625,19.536,13.153375,that i found to be uh an invasion is when i pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the,1,0
sw4365A-ms98-a,21,A,57.739125,69.64225,11.903125,oh yeah that's true i try to do most of my own to  but nowadays a lot of these cars are getting to be especially on engines getting to be computerized and stuff so ,2,0
sw4365A-ms98-a,27,A,83.9345,88.04525,4.11075,uh i think sometimes that could be the computer going bad on you,1,0
sw4365A-ms98-a,65,A,191.23225,196.319125,5.086875,the part than it would be to have it done down there so i just went ahead and had them do it,1,0
sw4366B-ms98-a,43,B,198.208375,202.53,4.321625,and a level four type of care would be someone that,1,0
sw4366B-ms98-a,47,B,225.633375,231.139875,5.5065,twenty four hour supervision of some kind even though it may be minimal,1,0
sw4366B-ms98-a,49,B,233.20225,236.009875,2.807625,but i think  it can be helpful,1,0
sw4367A-ms98-a,2,A,1.2815,7.30125,6.01975,well let's see i see i'm gonna i'm gonna be guilty of not being able to say a whole lot about this i'm not real,1,0
sw4367A-ms98-a,14,A,85.610375,91.908,6.297625,right oh it it is a budget i mean i certainly consider it to be a budget but i was just under the idea that uh,1,0
sw4367A-ms98-a,15,A,91.908,100.920375,9.012375,i knew i c- i would be able to do that and that uh y- you have to be uh responsible for your own,2,0
sw4367A-ms98-a,16,A,100.920375,115.542375,14.622,uh  retirement and welfare and so i said okay this you know i- i can do this so i will do that you know so it early you know when i first started in that you know quite a few years ago i- said i- i know that i will always be able to afford this ,1,0
sw4367A-ms98-a,39,A,223.2385,236.156875,12.918375,that that i want even though i may not they may not be something that i really need but i always find the best price for it and i look around for a long time and and let it let myself get past that that initial state,1,0
sw4367B-ms98-a,9,B,46.055375,55.4095,9.354125,right okay well that's good position to be in i guess if you don't have to worry about budgeting that what's left over goes to investments,1,0
sw4367B-ms98-a,10,B,55.4095,65.46925,10.05975,so you don't you don't then actually plan that this month i'm gonna invest five hundred or five thousand or whatever it might be,1,0
sw4367B-ms98-a,54,B,255.97225,268.845875,12.873625,okay well we do that same kind of planning in that if we're going to get something you know whatever it may be and we're comfortable and have most the things we need or want the,1,0
sw4368A-ms98-a,43,A,181.664875,186.139375,4.4745,let's see i pay about ten dollars a month to be a member of this fitness,1,0
sw4368B-ms98-a,29,B,122.59975,128.95025,6.3505,uh they seem like they would be classified as high impact but maybe there was more flow to it so it wasn't so jarring,1,0
sw4368B-ms98-a,40,B,154.335375,156.574,2.238625,cause both feet can't be on the floor at one time,1,0
sw4368B-ms98-a,70,B,253.546125,259.2495,5.703375,or depending on how the game went it could be like that right after uh right in the morning getting to work,1,0
sw4369A-ms98-a,24,A,107.047,121.31975,14.27275,i- i wouldn't be an activist on it cause there's so many more important things i think i mean i admit that some innocent people get killed and i believe you're correct that has been documented it happens occasionally and it's very th- th- that's that's quite unfortunate ,1,0
sw4369A-ms98-a,27,A,149.553875,155.459375,5.9055,didn't say you know even that even the the fraction that would be represented among criminals are convicted more often,1,0
sw4369A-ms98-a,28,A,155.459375,169.1875,13.728125,and in fact i just asked him the question is it is it true that isn't it true that minorities you know from peo- in general people from lower socioeconomic groups tend to commit more violent crime and so wouldn't you expect them_1 to be  to to be convicted more often  ,2,0
sw4369A-ms98-a,31,A,184.3225,195.87,11.5475,especially if you have an interest group that comes up with a study that supports their own position if they did the work i always tend to be a little suspicious of it and that might've been the Southern Poverty Law Project or something that did that,1,0
sw4369A-ms98-a,44,A,260.838375,267.40275,6.564375,i know there're some states like i think Texas is probably the leader in the country i'm not sure of that but i think it may be is that right,1,0
sw4369A-ms98-a,49,A,280.0775,292.272,12.1945,yeah i think that that you know most southern states tend to have capital punishment more than northern states and a state like Minnesota for example i don't know but i'd be almost sure that they don't have capital punishments Wis- Wisconsin the same way,1,0
sw4369B-ms98-a,5,B,9.41425,24.206125,14.791875,um for every thousand criminals let free if one innocent person is uh killed that that's a terrible thing for the state to be doing and i agree i remember watching a a documentary film a couple of years ago,1,0
sw4370A-ms98-a,16,A,70.410625,82.752125,12.3415,i suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone who's well educated to be able to to winnow the facts from the from the prejudice,1,0
sw4370A-ms98-a,37,A,172.39475,175.084375,2.689625,well i suppose you may be right on that,1,0
sw4370B-ms98-a,13,B,81.243625,85.479,4.235375,right but it still has to be a group of your peers,1,0
sw4370B-ms98-a,20,B,120.13175,127.390875,7.259125,so uh i think the jury selection process is pretty neat but i don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment,1,0
sw4370B-ms98-a,21,B,127.390875,140.733625,13.34275,afterwards i think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have i mean you're talking about the person's already been found guilty,1,0
sw4370B-ms98-a,22,B,140.733625,153.87125,13.137625,right and many times i've seen on trials they have on TV the jury -ill make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever but i think that it should be up to the judge and the uh lawyers,1,0
sw4370B-ms98-a,23,B,153.87125,157.335375,3.464125,to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be,1,0
sw4370B-ms98-a,27,B,173.77675,180.892125,7.115375,as opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure,1,0
sw4370B-ms98-a,31,B,211.39125,221.868375,10.477125,then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury,1,0
sw4370B-ms98-a,32,B,221.868375,230.265875,8.3975,at least in California they're supposed to be not during the trial during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background,1,0
sw4370B-ms98-a,37,B,248.460875,257.901375,9.4405,well if it's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time,1,0
sw4370B-ms98-a,44,B,286.463125,290.083125,3.62,i think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are,1,0
sw4371A-ms98-a,21,A,97.927875,106.83675,8.908875,but uh i- i- i guess like all these people can't be that wrong you know in terms uh of uh of how th- how they are,1,0
sw4371B-ms98-a,34,B,108.46625,114.3165,5.85025,it was uh i- i forget the name of the magazine used to be Changing Times sort of like a Consumer Reports magazine,1,0
sw4372A-ms98-a,8,A,64.79125,77.36725,12.576,th- th- then why not pay pay the sales tax to Pennsylvania corporations have to why should an individual just because it's just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax,1,0
sw4372B-ms98-a,16,B,175.996375,190.051125,14.05475,right but the point is is that businesses do that the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question that's a cost of doing business the burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer,1,0
sw4372B-ms98-a,26,B,254.982875,264.7195,9.736625,um but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that,1,0
sw4372B-ms98-a,27,B,264.7195,272.233,7.5135,um the opportunity f- to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided,1,0
sw4373A-ms98-a,17,A,75.356625,88.199,12.842375,who knows how many times before and it was just presented so dryly and i suppose that if um if you're going to pay teachers the salary that they're paid that's that's the level of education that's going to be presented,1,0
sw4374A-ms98-a,49,A,289.6565,299.394,9.7375,exactly you know if you are not willing to budget your money then y- uh you know if you're not willing to be careful and live on what you make,1,0
sw4375A-ms98-a,12,A,34.36975,39.652,5.28225,how shall i say it variegated ones the the real brightly colored ones don't seem to be too hardy,1,0
sw4376A-ms98-a,6,A,21.605625,24.738625,3.133, well it should be used as a deterrent do you think,1,0
sw4376A-ms98-a,8,A,25.96,31.98775,6.02775,or should it be used uh a- to prevent further uh crime li-,1,0
sw4376A-ms98-a,33,A,188.41325,199.197625,10.784375,uh terminate older people than younger people since the uh uh integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less,1,0
sw4376B-ms98-a,6,B,13.489625,20.41225,6.922625,premeditated murder mass murders uh you know that type of thing i don't think it should just be used,1,0
sw4377A-ms98-a,24,A,77.894625,82.263,4.368375,right you know i- i find there's that you just have to be really careful,1,0
sw4377A-ms98-a,41,A,156.30175,162.748,6.44625,you know it's it's like well you know i could get two hundred distributors on to me each selling one dollar a week and i'll be rich but,1,0
sw4377B-ms98-a,22,B,72.08225,78.969625,6.887375,right or from the sidewalk vendors that are supposed to be the real thing,1,0
sw4379B-ms98-a,44,B,238.36175,249.431625,11.069875,um you know there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months and certain times when that will be left over but that's completely up to me how i do that and then um because i don't work i stay home,1,0
sw4380A-ms98-a,18,A,104.39475,114.140375,9.745625,you should still be able to read   which it s- i mean it sounds like uh now i think maybe it jus- started changing in the past few years because uh,1,0
sw4380A-ms98-a,34,A,180.67625,187.4645,6.78825,yeah and again i don't i mean again i don't know that i'm you know how qualified i mean i think it'd be interesting,1,0
sw4380A-ms98-a,37,A,200.51125,205.150625,4.639375,i think that would be an interesting experience but uh i haven't done that,1,0
sw4380B-ms98-a,22,B,84.964375,97.06225,12.097875,like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that more than they would you know in areas where they,1,0
sw4380B-ms98-a,35,B,153.591625,158.7715,5.179875,i can't say what it would be like to uh grow up in a really oppressed uh region,1,0
sw4381A-ms98-a,3,A,26.272,40.517375,14.245375,um i don't know seventeenth out of twenty three industrialized nations we're really low i mean i'd be really even surprised if they were that high these are these are scores on standardized tests and yet if you uh give American students the question i am good at math,1,0
sw4381A-ms98-a,6,A,66.015375,72.450375,6.435,and that can be seen in you know in math scores it can be seen in sex education where we've had,2,0
sw4381A-ms98-a,7,A,72.450375,85.649875,13.1995,twenty years of generally available sex education in this country at the same time we have a rising crisis of teenage pregnancy uh it can be seen in the fact that students cheat a lot more at least admit to cheating a lot more than they used to,1,0
sw4381A-ms98-a,8,A,85.649875,98.24475,12.594875,they're not told what's right and what's wrong and they're not taught what they needed to be taught the urge they're they're they're taught to discover their own values and their own interest and if you let a kid do that that's the way to get,1,0
sw4381A-ms98-a,40,A,212.0645,225.098625,13.034125,is you need more flexibility to do things the way you see that they should be done and she said yeah i agree with that entirely that the bureaucracy really hamstrings teachers um they they they in many places are just told what textbook to teach from,1,0
sw4381A-ms98-a,41,A,225.098625,239.743125,14.6445,whether or not they think it's a good one i mean the decision can be made from a central authority in the state to which is subject to lots of political pressure the teachers don't get to choose themselves what what book to teach uh uh teach from they go don't get to choose what order to cover things in and ,1,0
sw4382A-ms98-a,47,A,247.30275,251.35675,4.054,you know you'd it be one way to cut the pollution in half,1,0
sw4382B-ms98-a,29,B,149.05275,152.004125,2.951375,and i think they're also gonna be making it uh,1,0
sw4383A-ms98-a,1,A,0,4.763875,4.763875, do you think should be done for the the uh huge budget we have,1,0
sw4383A-ms98-a,4,A,36.564125,43.246625,6.6825,we elected him for that uh again and he said that he didn't think that we'd ever be able to have uh balanced budget,1,0
sw4383A-ms98-a,9,A,61.885125,64.54025,2.655125,we'll be like California soon right,1,0
sw4383A-ms98-a,15,A,72.462375,77.57375,5.111375,the year two thousand that uh we'd be totally dependent on foreign capital,1,0
sw4383A-ms98-a,48,A,233.096875,245.536875,12.44,a lot of the uh you know it'd be a good way of getting revenues and all so bring in line towards savings and and putting money into uh instead of spending into investment,1,0

sw4607A-ms98-a,46,A,254.703875,264.9375,10.233625,but  it it just doesn't function in our court system over here we we won't allow you to be uh frisked by a cop uh without good reason,1,0
sw4607B-ms98-a,11,B,102.654625,115.5535,12.898875,that seems to be the major thing and we just recently with all the problems that there are in Boston we did have i was thinking we did have one crime in Framingham where a girl picked up a guy at a bar,1,0

sw4612B-ms98-a,26,B,138.4815,143.99625,5.51475,in Texas Instruments oh yeah i actually used i used to be chief speech scientist at Texas Instruments,1,0

sw4615B-ms98-a,33,B,205.466,210.654625,5.188625,yeah checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be i'm convinced,1,0
sw4615B-ms98-a,37,B,239.10375,251.175375,12.071625,yeah the interest is so low i mean it it's nice for people buying homes but for older people who have money in CDs or whatever it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever,1,0
sw4615B-ms98-a,39,B,280.358,290.376625,10.018625,yeah i'm i'm with a small company now and i hope that uh if we're successful that they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing that'll be very nice,1,0
sw4616B-ms98-a,10,B,72.6065,84.267875,11.661375, the problem i have with Newsweek and Time is i never had any time to read them but that's the reason i get magazines because it's mostly current so if i really want to be kept up current i usually get a newspaper instead of those weekly magazines,1,0
sw4616B-ms98-a,29,B,222.782375,231.09875,8.316375,and you can be talking to a customer service representative while you are looking at the pamphlet where with the magazine any questions you have you write to the editor and you have to wait for the answer,1,0
sw4616B-ms98-a,35,B,255.441,259.901125,4.460125,well Reader's Digest used to be good on coupons and all of a sudden they just kind of cut back on it and,1,0
sw4617A-ms98-a,9,A,27.69925,38.66925,10.97,whether the judge should be the one that does the uh sentencing and seems to me that that's i think that's the way it's done now uh at least,1,0
sw4617A-ms98-a,21,A,78.243625,87.5545,9.310875,and i think that may i that may be an exception as well because_1 i think that doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than than the judge,1,0
sw4617A-ms98-a,35,A,168.911,177.552,8.641,but i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and you'd hate to be one of those,1,0
sw4617A-ms98-a,37,A,181.950375,195.93425,13.983875,uh the verdict should be required to be unanimous which again i think is the way it is now that all that all verdicts well maybe not i don't know at least in capital cases i'd think they'd have to be unanimous,3,0
sw4617B-ms98-a,21,B,73.98375,78.087625,4.103875,like everybody else even though they're they're supposed to be impartial but,1,0
sw4617B-ms98-a,41,B,129.790875,141.340625,11.54975,not it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge it's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people  put it to sleep you know just get it out you know it's not able to fit in you know,1,0
sw4618A-ms98-a,3,A,4.364375,13.446125,9.08175,um no i haven't but in my job i'm a nurse and we are allowed to be i mean you know this is the rules that they can do this,1,0
sw4618A-ms98-a,21,A,99.870875,106.15925,6.288375,but a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing,1,0
sw4618A-ms98-a,25,A,114.475125,120.02725,5.552125,um you should because you should be given another chance or at least,1,0
sw4618A-ms98-a,44,A,219.493375,225.991875,6.4985,you know so as a patient i feel well yeah we probably should be protected but on the other hand,1,0
sw4618A-ms98-a,46,A,227.607375,236.9765,9.369125,i should be protected from it they don't test my patients for too  you know i guess you sort of you have to have trust some place along the way,1,0
sw4618A-ms98-a,48,A,240.324125,247.662625,7.3385,so i don't know and i- i think it could be used to hassle somebody if someone was out to get you,1,0
sw4618A-ms98-a,54,A,269.029625,274.73025,5.700625,but maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago,1,0
sw4618A-ms98-a,61,A,296.280125,298.53,2.249875,yeah so that probably wouldn't be too good either,1,0
sw4618B-ms98-a,7,B,30.282375,40.64275,10.360375,um not really but i've always worked on a university level but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff,1,0
sw4619A-ms98-a,22,A,112.387875,123.711875,11.324,uh there i would say it's the same thing it's a it's a nice uh is relatively nice environment but again um it must be depressing for the people who who are who who are just,1,0

sw4619A-ms98-a,26,A,150.640875,160.145125,9.50425,i think s- yeah i think they're relatively re- respectful yeah and and concerned that in as much as they can be i- i think sometimes you know i've noticed,1,0
sw4619B-ms98-a,22,B,185.3845,196.208125,10.823625,yeah it it's possible i was thinking also that there'd be there could be a fair um burn out factor um in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are,2,0
sw4619B-ms98-a,23,B,196.208125,201.4905,5.282375,sometimes depending on the person not gonna be what we would perceive of as rational needs,1,0

sw4622B-ms98-a,63,B,253.3185,265.550375,12.231875, i know eastern now the other thing we do here of course is a single not quite a single climate we have uh we do have some snow in the wintertime and it can be,1,0
sw4622B-ms98-a,65,B,271.1245,273.334625,2.210125,and i know that uh you know it can be,1,0
sw4624A-ms98-a,28,A,124.973625,137.064625,12.091,i- i think in general you know technology as nice as it is is causing a lot it's just too easy now to it's like you know Bay banks used to be you know you could do anything over the phone,1,0
sw4624B-ms98-a,37,B,252.236,262.464375,10.228375,yeah  i know i know it's just that cons- we need to have stronger consumer protection laws and we just don't seem to be able to get the government to do it,1,0
sw4628B-ms98-a,26,B,107.69425,114.85525,7.161,and it may not be true in every place in a lot of cases i think you're treated more like a number instead of a a person,1,0
sw4628B-ms98-a,37,B,178.8985,181.576875,2.678375,so there should be something,1,0
sw4628B-ms98-a,41,B,200.115,213.32725,13.21225,are not on the up and up all the time you know i don't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but you know a number of people can can be the downfall of company a company situation,1,0
sw4628B-ms98-a,47,B,240.803,245.851875,5.048875,ye- yes i do i really do i think it'd be better that way,1,0
sw4629B-ms98-a,19,B,90.121,93.9185,3.7975,you know that that money needs to be spent on on research,1,0
sw4629B-ms98-a,22,B,97.462625,99.920125,2.4575,you know it should be a a,1,0

sw4630A-ms98-a,4,A,7.34225,16.51225,9.17,uh take a look at it is the evening news and and then if i'm lucky i might be able to s- hear something through news wise but um other than that,1,0
sw4630A-ms98-a,76,A,292.700625,297.56125,4.860625,anyway i don't know if our time is getting up here or it's got to be fairly close to that,1,0
sw4630B-ms98-a,24,B,151.2615,154.665,3.4035,everybody was watching CNN that seemed to be the,1,0
sw4630B-ms98-a,25,B,154.665,156.681875,2.016875,place to be to,1,0
sw4630B-ms98-a,36,B,228.3445,235.22,6.8755,of uh i go surfing down here and i always want to watch the weather for when the waves are gonna be good,1,0
sw4630B-ms98-a,50,B,278.549,284.6215,6.0725,uh hundreds of miles out so i can predict my my week and where i'm gonna be,1,0
sw4630B-ms98-a,51,B,284.6215,288.104375,3.482875,so i can be at the at the beach when the waves start coming in,1,0
sw4633B-ms98-a,28,B,151.359625,160.850375,9.49075,and they practice three times a week and they have a game and it's just uh if there were more than one child i don't know there there would be no way to do it,1,0
sw4637A-ms98-a,9,A,59.24325,65.048125,5.804875,uh i think a a a good amount of money ought to go to the education which they they d- seem to be doing,1,0
sw4637A-ms98-a,18,A,111.67825,118.30625,6.628,you know how dangerous it could be i had answered a uh job ad f- we have a local VA hospital down here,1,0
sw4637A-ms98-a,22,A,140.297875,150.38275,10.084875,um you might be exposed to AIDS in the animals but you know you'd have gloves and this and that and it did make me flinch it did make me not want to do ,1,0
sw4637B-ms98-a,6,B,15.370625,19.776875,4.40625,it's going to be such an amazing,1,0
sw4637B-ms98-a,43,B,171.1915,174.598625,3.407125,that's true but you'd be surprised how many nurses don't,1,0
sw4637B-ms98-a,80,B,273.101125,281.62625,8.525125,uh that's exactly what i was going to say i don't really know how much we're spending it may be one of those things that takes twenty years to find anyway or fifty,1,0
sw4638A-ms98-a,26,A,143.2875,151.645125,8.357625,um traffic tickets things like that i mean i've known of people just to be picked up because they didn't pay their traffic tickets and,1,0
sw4638A-ms98-a,28,A,159.151375,173.16675,14.015375,so i don't know i just have a problem with overcrowded jails on crimes that nobody's really gonna get hurt uh financially maybe and and things like that and yes it has to be dealt with but i'm not sure that's the way,1,0
sw4638A-ms98-a,32,A,190.85,202.04125,11.19125,i think that it turns out sometimes that the victims are the ones that have to defend themselves rather than the criminals and i think that's another thing that needs to be addressed too,1,0
sw4638A-ms98-a,40,A,243.33325,258.243375,14.910125,i don't know i i've been through a two year divorce recently and i find that the system sucks to put it bluntly and so you know  i just i don't have a lot of respect anymore for what i thought you know would be fair you just figure oh well the judge will be fair well,2,0
sw4638B-ms98-a,6,B,19.408375,31.103875,11.6955,so it it's definitely a concern something that needs to be worked on i know that it affects my everyday life in that uh you know my fiance is very paranoid about making sure everything's locked,1,0
sw4638B-ms98-a,7,B,31.103875,41.07775,9.973875,uh you know i- it also concerns me because i have a convertible and uh you know there's certain areas around here where i'd be afraid to drive with my top down,1,0
sw4638B-ms98-a,13,B,119.1955,123.43725,4.24175,but putting it that way that is kind of ironic that she'd be using up tax dollars but,1,0
sw4638B-ms98-a,17,B,128.193,138.517625,10.324625,however you know some of the crimes that people ought to be locked up for are uh are uh you know not even things that would be major crimes but they'd still be dangerous for example uh drunken driving,3,0
sw4638B-ms98-a,41,B,271.223125,277.930625,6.7075,course in Florida the judges are elected so um not only are they not fair they try to be popular at times,1,0
sw4640A-ms98-a,4,A,11.528125,17.172875,5.64475,i- i don't see him as that kind of a guy i can believe like that Bill Clinton might be,1,0
sw4640A-ms98-a,11,A,45.13425,57.27125,12.137,yeah well you know i th- i think if you like compare us to other governments you know i- i think we tend to be overly critical of our own government i mean you go and look like a lot of these African countries where corruption is ri- right out in the open it's like,1,0
sw4640A-ms98-a,12,A,57.27125,64.00525,6.734,you know you want to do something you know you better even be the president's best friend or you know pay me a lot of money,1,0
sw4640B-ms98-a,26,B,193.30075,205.21175,11.911,i'm still awfully glad to be here uh so i guess the you  this this question was can we ever get uh totally uh honest government and i would say uh,1,0
sw4641A-ms98-a,31,A,198.740875,205.3915,6.650625,yeah w- we're just kind of like losing and it it just seems to be a snowball effect i mean  you know we keep losing more,1,0
sw4641A-ms98-a,41,A,249.036875,254.382875,5.346,we're trying and if it works tha- that'd be great for us but what about you know the rest of the industry,1,0
sw4641A-ms98-a,43,A,262.9455,275.18375,12.23825,yeah although although we we go on that subject i- i because_1 i looked at HDTV uh but i- i don't like standards that are on it's s- still on a fixed resolution which means it'll be eventually outdated also,1,0
sw4641B-ms98-a,5,B,22.3585,31.99425,9.63575,and uh for me really i don't have to be terribly concerned about uh benefits outside because_1 i own my own company,1,0
sw4641B-ms98-a,6,B,31.99425,43.228875,11.234625,but uh the worst problem that i think uh out here is affecting people and i think would be the most positive job benefit is job security these days,1,0
sw4641B-ms98-a,30,B,205.980375,212.344,6.363625,well Cupertino seems to be one of the every single software company ever sees always sees Cupertino  ,1,0
sw4641B-ms98-a,31,B,212.344,221.10425,8.76025,so you guys at least don't have those kinds of you know the only pro- software seems to be still a US strength versus hardware,1,0
sw4641B-ms98-a,37,B,254.431875,265.099,10.667125,yeah well the hardware you know HDTV if we can keep control of that that looks like something that we could have good strengths on and there would be a lot of new jobs created,1,0
sw4643A-ms98-a,7,A,36.82,39.18925,2.36925,oh he'll be delighted,1,0
sw4643B-ms98-a,5,B,28.714125,34.115625,5.4015,colors um you know the crayons that are sticking up it'll be the headboard and the-,1,0
sw4644B-ms98-a,25,B,214.983625,223.5405,8.556875,that's all the town workers water and sewer and where it's a very large town it's actually should be a city but they kept it a town,1,0
sw4646B-ms98-a,10,B,71.12425,76.585125,5.460875,a nurse on staff just in case they needed her but they wanted to be independent as well,1,0
sw4646B-ms98-a,27,B,189.92325,199.755625,9.832375,choices to make so they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time i guess that's a problem too for people wait lists,1,0
sw4646B-ms98-a,39,B,267.605125,277.887625,10.2825,it's just a shame that's the way it has to be i think the retirement home idea's a nice idea to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay and,1,0
sw4646B-ms98-a,40,B,277.887625,286.47875,8.591125,because_1 uh like if your spouse died all of a sudden you be all alone it'd be nice to go someplace people similar to you and have friends,2,0
sw4649A-ms98-a,54,A,217.206,224.276875,7.070875,there's absolutely no question that you're gonna be the best  child care  for that kid so  yeah do it as long as you can ,1,0
sw4655A-ms98-a,2,A,0.545125,13.021875,12.47675,well i'll just briefly um i worked in a nursing home so i kind of know from way back uh how things used to be run and i think there's been definite changes of nursing homes but,1,0
sw4655A-ms98-a,3,A,13.021875,20.79,7.768125,i think uh if i personally had to put one of my parents in a nursing home they would have to be pretty bad off,1,0
sw4655A-ms98-a,4,A,20.79,32.4735,11.6835,to where i couldn't take care of them at all it would be something that  you know i would certainly  if they're forgetting things or whatever i'd prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care,1,0
sw4655A-ms98-a,5,A,32.4735,45.056,12.5825,where somebody comes in and they cook meals and they clean their house for them that kind of thing so they still have their own independence and not reliable you know they don't have to be in a nursing home situation but uh,1,0
sw4655A-ms98-a,43,A,268.490125,280.17425,11.684125,and yeah yeah and you have more competition and i think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community,1,0
sw4655A-ms98-a,45,A,286.152875,299.458,13.305125,and i look back at it and say jeez you know i it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there but my grandmother uh later on got cancer and uh could no longer well actually she,1,0
sw4655B-ms98-a,20,B,240.7255,242.723125,1.997625,be violent,1,0
sw4659A-ms98-a,3,A,9.593375,13.761625,4.16825,uh oh i can be but go ahead ,1,0
sw4659A-ms98-a,17,A,92.129125,105.577125,13.448,you're expected to exactly and i recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse it should be less because we have a microwave and our grandmother's had to bake brownies and,1,0
sw4659A-ms98-a,24,A,149.56,161.252875,11.692875,and i think that's jus- of course a part of it is technology i mean our kids where would they be without Nintendo and you know their TV shows and that and some of that is really bad i think,1,0
sw4659B-ms98-a,3,B,1.47,7.834875,6.364875,well um i can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago um,1,0
sw4659B-ms98-a,14,B,55.846125,66.340625,10.4945,yeah uh a business associate of mine was was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail and you had to do something this was concerning the S E C,1,0
sw4659B-ms98-a,32,B,194.194375,205.95075,11.756375,what generally tends to happen i mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country,1,0
sw4659B-ms98-a,40,B,237.94675,250.02075,12.074,most of the of the next generation is going to be in or or an ex- ex- extremely large par- part of the next generation is going to be you know second generation f- uh from immigrant parents,2,0
sw4659B-ms98-a,41,B,250.02075,256.89525,6.8745,and they're going to be really struggling and i don't think that America is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom,1,0
sw4659B-ms98-a,42,B,256.89525,261.29975,4.4045,is necessarily considered to be good ,1,0
sw4660B-ms98-a,3,B,2.78775,15.66325,12.8755,generally i get most of my news from uh the radio and then sometimes um if i've got time i'll be reading the front page of the newspaper and just fall off on the articles that i like,1,0
sw4660B-ms98-a,4,B,15.66325,26.913125,11.249875,um also since my wife likes to watch TV sometimes uh  just having be- just being there i get uh you know i have to watch the news late at night with TV,1,0
sw4661A-ms98-a,8,A,115,123.394,8.394,hum tha- it's interesting you're approaching it from the  sort of administrating your education just you know trying to get the class and be there,1,0
sw4661A-ms98-a,16,A,185.192,198.178375,12.986375,first of all do something practical because the art for me um didn't work out very practically i got out of school when the Vietnam draft evasion was going on and everybody wanted to be a teacher there were no jobs,1,0
sw4661A-ms98-a,18,A,208.228125,215.08875,6.860625,so sad you know there's a whole bunch of college graduates who are learning how to type just to be able to to make some money,1,0
sw4661B-ms98-a,15,B,80.428625,86.586875,6.15825,for students who who need a chance to be forced to fend for themselves,1,0
sw4661B-ms98-a,18,B,100.681,115.57175,14.89075,to make it on her own and she graduated from the place in four years by learning to be smart and picking courses that uh at the right times and right priorities and i can see that as advantageous but there are a lot of people for whom this is just a waste of time,1,0
sw4661B-ms98-a,34,B,205.536375,209.81575,4.279375,jus- just to be able to find a job that you would qualify for,1,0
sw4661B-ms98-a,40,B,231.696375,246.683625,14.98725,that it may be that what you want to do and it may be a very practical thing to go into doesn't seem attractive because what you've learned of it so far is is not interesting a lot of people are turned off from math because of high school math,2,0
sw4664A-ms98-a,16,A,83.88775,84.825375,0.937625,be-,1,0
sw4666B-ms98-a,4,B,20.5615,29.77525,9.21375, well to be honest with you i'm not from Minneapolis in fact i've only been up here a few months and i'm going back at the end of next month,1,0
sw4666B-ms98-a,29,B,104.548125,111.752125,7.204,well yeah  sorry about that yeah uh as far as the Twins are concerned it seems to be real good,1,0
sw4666B-ms98-a,32,B,122.257875,126.678875,4.421,that's pretty good i guess it looks like they'll be doing pretty well,1,0
sw4666B-ms98-a,66,B,292.411625,295.112875,2.70125,yeah so it had to be November anyway,1,0
sw4667A-ms98-a,6,A,68.996125,72.071375,3.07525,yeah there there wouldn't have to be some way to pay for it,1,0
sw4667A-ms98-a,32,A,179.529,186.678625,7.149625,to be needing it in a little while by the time you get to the end of your twenty six weeks uh the elections will be over and,2,0
sw4667B-ms98-a,4,B,12.97525,20.684375,7.709125,and i just know that it's first you know i could get it where i work an- but it would be like a hundred dollars a month which is a lot to me,1,0
sw4667B-ms98-a,6,B,30.647875,39.723,9.075125,and i i realize that you know it would for that to be true you'd you'd have to increase taxes and stuff like that but uh,1,0
sw4667B-ms98-a,10,B,52.151375,56.09025,3.938875,i would be willing to you know pay more taxes but,1,0
sw4667B-ms98-a,13,B,65.948,69.309375,3.361375,would be to you know have to tax more,1,0
sw4667B-ms98-a,33,B,290.465,296.7685,6.3035,well by the um the same note of what you're saying there could be pros in that situation um,1,0

sw4675B-ms98-a,26,B,99.510625,106.66925,7.158625,but i do try to build in a little extra money each month to to be able to do that type of thing so,1,0
sw4675B-ms98-a,50,B,193.102625,199.66175,6.559125,that'd be good because yeah most people are spending three or four months di- you know at least digging out after Christmas so,1,0
sw4679A-ms98-a,19,A,126.206375,131.337,5.130625,um there ought to be uh um well,1,0
sw4679A-ms98-a,45,A,272.637,276.463125,3.826125,and um there'd be more honest settlements instead of this um,1,0
sw4679B-ms98-a,27,B,160.902625,169.930875,9.02825,conservative when it come to that the the sentencing is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases,1,0
sw4679B-ms98-a,40,B,235.46775,243.522,8.05425,but i- i do think it need to be shaken up a little bit but the thing is too maybe they need more of uh,1,0
sw4679B-ms98-a,42,B,246.67775,254.790875,8.113125,to to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know Joe Blow or whoever,1,0
sw4680A-ms98-a,13,A,79.523875,91.927875,12.404,uh unfortunately i think that that the immigrants tend to really stretch the social services that can be provided to the folks uh,1,0
sw4680B-ms98-a,14,B,59.5955,70.5485,10.953,even with all the tragedies if you step back and look at it the fact that people want to come here must be that there's something better here than or at least they think there's something better here than there is uh wherever they're from,1,0
sw4681A-ms98-a,18,A,79.520125,88.021875,8.50175,they're looking at what's the best buy it used to be you could go if you had a company you had to go through certain people and you didn't care what you paid,1,0
sw4681A-ms98-a,32,A,166.512125,181.0545,14.542375,but you're still gonna owe the government as much money so by the end of this coming year what's gonna happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings uh account,1,0
sw4681A-ms98-a,33,A,181.0545,190.20975,9.15525,they won't be able to pay it and there'll be a lot of problems because of that you know put people into you know January or February which is always supposed to be this month,3,0
sw4681A-ms98-a,34,A,190.20975,196.473625,6.263875,after Christmas is supposed to be high spending because everything is on sale nobody's gonna have the money to spend,1,0
sw4681A-ms98-a,35,A,196.473625,205.305125,8.8315,they're gonna be paying on their taxes so they're gonna have to just cut back so i don't know where the answer is and ,1,0
sw4681A-ms98-a,47,A,271.423875,274.82675,3.402875,maybe it'll have to be just individual state tax,1,0
sw4681B-ms98-a,41,B,179.676,181.77775,2.10175,nope they won't be able to pay,1,0
sw4682A-ms98-a,18,A,139.70275,149.51775,9.815,and she told me and i said well i really appreciate it i said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store and it turned out she was the assistant manager,1,0
sw4682A-ms98-a,28,A,272.938,279.588125,6.650125,that's really good it used to be like that but i don't think most places are like that anymore,1,0
sw4682B-ms98-a,49,B,254.291,263.5175,9.2265,they are um they're very good about um insuring like the customer's always right and you know  no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they,1,0
sw4688A-ms98-a,56,A,269.909125,279.1145,9.205375,even more in the market for a a budgetary thing than than than most people probably are might be terms of keeping keeping score of input and output,1,0
sw4688B-ms98-a,13,B,87.080125,98.71225,11.632125,so it's a lot it's very hard on a {nonfixed} income because i don't know how many days i'm going to be called in and whether i am or not to try to keep track of finances,1,0
sw4688B-ms98-a,28,B,181.06475,184.060875,2.996125,they don't like to be absent before a vacation,1,0
sw4691A-ms98-a,8,A,41.8365,47.033625,5.197125,yeah well it'll be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you,1,0
sw4691B-ms98-a,32,B,116.815125,125.12725,8.312125,uh and they have a good time and everything and that's suppose to be some of the uh male bonding and the and the uh the male instincts i guess or something about uh,1,0
sw4693A-ms98-a,10,A,44.822125,48.96025,4.138125,what do they do i mean they can be real boring i've i've been to a couple as a kid,1,0
sw4693A-ms98-a,33,A,161.440875,166.505625,5.06475,oh okay well the first Sunday after the Fourth of July has got to be hot right,1,0
sw4693A-ms98-a,36,A,170.225625,175.164,4.938375,that's what i meant could be the springtime or something like that the kids are still in school then huh,1,0
sw4693B-ms98-a,23,B,87.529375,97.4795,9.950125,so uh but it it ours is the type of family if i had no place to be i could call anyone of my aunts or my cousins and they would say come and stay with me for a few weeks,1,0
sw4693B-ms98-a,32,B,145.373875,150.822875,5.449,so we have a facility where we can be inside but yet the kids can go and be in the lake if they want to,2,0
sw4693B-ms98-a,34,B,156.438,161.8925,5.4545,oh and that's set it's going to be it's always the first Sunday after the Fourth of July,1,0
sw4695B-ms98-a,3,B,1.204375,4.29775,3.093375,um i'm a more o- of a wanna be,1,0
sw4695B-ms98-a,39,B,179.820125,189.7185,9.898375,but um for field day which is an exercise in the summer where ham it know it's it's it's a couple of things it's supposed to be a uh a demonstration of how ,1,0
sw4695B-ms98-a,40,B,189.7185,197.216875,7.498375,the ham community can be mobilized to to operate under simulated emergency or field conditions,1,0
sw4696A-ms98-a,5,A,37.036875,42.75475,5.717875,well that could be uh Ro- Ross Perot is not a politician i mean,1,0
sw4696A-ms98-a,21,A,134.375,143.2605,8.8855,and uh i- since then he's started a new company but i think he must be a very good salesman or at least he was at some time um,1,0
sw4696A-ms98-a,27,A,159.253125,172.589375,13.33625,  that's right i i'm just curious to see what's gonna happen to the political scene uh if he gets on the ballot in all the states and whatnot do you do you think he cans be a spoiler for Bush,1,0
sw4696A-ms98-a,34,A,223.4645,225.864375,2.399875,uh y- yeah could be,1,0
sw4696A-ms98-a,35,A,225.864375,232.11175,6.247375,could be i- i also suspect that one aspect of his personality would be that he would be rea- really tenacious,3,0
sw4696B-ms98-a,4,B,14.27775,28.737125,14.459375,but that's about it i just find it interesting that somebody with that much money uh would be interested in the presidency in the first place i guess it's it's as much you know just the sense of power and the sense of being able to accomplish things,1,0
sw4696B-ms98-a,22,B,147.733125,149.487625,1.7545,be kind of a change,1,0
sw4697A-ms98-a,3,A,10.47475,17.40775,6.933,that um maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again,1,0
sw4697A-ms98-a,4,A,17.40775,27.73425,10.3265,um so that um a judge i think would be the most appropriate person to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day,2,0
sw4697A-ms98-a,14,A,58.687125,72.512875,13.82575,one thing i heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have a a mock court i mean it's supposed to be all legal and everything uh you go and you present your case the other side presents their case and you're done with it,1,0
sw4697A-ms98-a,16,A,84.411875,89.225875,4.814,um so i that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way,1,0
sw4697B-ms98-a,5,B,42.8965,56.97525,14.07875,so a a judge you're right should have the whole dossier of the  there and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better pri- position to give an appropriate uh sentencing,1,0
sw4697B-ms98-a,9,B,88.52275,95.280875,6.758125,in other words not not there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial,1,0
sw4697B-ms98-a,18,B,153.92575,166.283625,12.357875,yeah so i agree that that should be encouraged you know people should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to,1,0
sw4697B-ms98-a,22,B,184.774125,191.390375,6.61625,yeah and i suspect it in cases like i guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil is that right,1,0
sw4697B-ms98-a,25,B,204.50225,210.126625,5.624375,the use of the jury is very often to the lawyer's advantage and i think that may be where jury,1,0
sw4697B-ms98-a,26,B,210.126625,218.466625,8.34,use is overdone you know i mean there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently but the lawyers are really,1,0
sw4698B-ms98-a,30,B,157.348125,169.120375,11.77225,yeah it's i- i uh i have a modem in my computer so i can log into the sys- the uh network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful but um,1,0
sw4702A-ms98-a,12,A,28.12225,40.875,12.75275,do anything like that on their own and i guess it would have to be really and truly universal and then i think you start running into all sorts of people's religious objections and  you know and and how do you,1,0
sw4702A-ms98-a,35,A,215.354375,227.468375,12.114,uh and so that y- you know i'm sort of torn that idea makes a whole lot of sense too people who are just along for the ride why should they say how my money should be spent and why should they say what i ought to do,1,0
sw4702A-ms98-a,42,A,263.291375,273.121125,9.82975,right and and that's that'd be kind of an interesting way of doing it i think if you're going to do something like that because it instead of voting,1,0
sw4702A-ms98-a,48,A,292.88725,298.946,6.05875,yeah well and and the other thing is such for it to to truly be help,1,0
sw4702B-ms98-a,25,B,227.95825,239.6225,11.66425,well there should be some tangible benefit uh i- if you really want to get into something where you want to have a full participation and have it work well is to have something where they select,1,0
sw4703A-ms98-a,4,A,3.824125,14.703375,10.87925,well i can see it in certain cases where it might be uh somebody's in a position that uh perhaps a lot of lives are involved like maybe um pilots that,1,0
sw4703A-ms98-a,9,A,52.2725,65.139375,12.866875,there's got to be like a limitation do we drug test everybody that comes in or do we kind of say well you can be drug tested and you look okay because you look this way you're you're very conservative and and,2,0
sw4703A-ms98-a,10,A,65.139375,74.072,8.932625,there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs but the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of uh the conservative or whatever could be drug tested,1,0
sw4703A-ms98-a,28,A,155.24475,168.411625,13.166875,exactly the only thing is uh the one issue that i would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive,1,0
sw4703A-ms98-a,43,A,250.1935,260.375125,10.181625,this is kind of iffy you know are they really on drugs or are they on  you know what i'm saying where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person,1,0
sw4703B-ms98-a,12,B,145.405125,155.930375,10.52525,uh then there's the- there's the whole question that that a that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is gonna be more healthy i don't think anybody would argue with that,2,0
sw4703B-ms98-a,24,B,266.474375,277.69425,11.219875,right well yeah i think clearly the person who is the line o- line manager of the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing that should go to an entirely different,1,0
sw4707A-ms98-a,65,A,249.20775,263.711,14.50325,if you add the um uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those who are um just looking for fun the- people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get the tax bill passed no matter what happens,1,0
sw4707A-ms98-a,68,A,273.80075,279.51575,5.715,um like a cultural lapse i mean people were always used to be willing to ante up for the schools they,1,0
sw4710A-ms98-a,16,A,71.51325,77.29075,5.7775,uh and there probably be a few instances in which i would think that maybe it wasn't warranted,1,0
sw4710A-ms98-a,49,A,236.6985,246.59675,9.89825,it uh uh you know people ought to be aware of what it is that you know what it is that they're doing and uh you know what what the sentence really means,1,0
sw4716A-ms98-a,3,A,8.444625,20.73325,12.288625,and i think there should be limitations of like semiautomatics uh things like that should not be just given out to anybody in fact you know i can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose,2,0
sw4716A-ms98-a,6,A,30.595875,41.37525,10.779375,but yet allow hunting rifles uh things that people would use for sporting type of uh uh activity those would be fine but when you get into um,1,0
sw4716A-ms98-a,22,A,97.01625,105.722625,8.706375,semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch a person and and uh get him down but um,1,0
sw4716A-ms98-a,26,A,133.348125,144.4155,11.067375,you know a small handgun um that can be you know put right in your coat pocket and nobody would see it but yet you can't stop people from having you know a handgun in their home,1,0
sw4716B-ms98-a,6,B,52.40675,61.789125,9.382375,i definitely think that there some things shouldn't be limited like like you said rifles and um hunting rifles and probably handguns for people who use them_1 to,1,0
sw4716B-ms98-a,61,B,289.708375,296.45475,6.746375,and i think maybe uh and that's the type of the thing that should be you know stressed,1,0
sw4717A-ms98-a,34,A,225.5265,238.688125,13.161625,so yeah i i tend to we have cable here and that tends to be pretty good for news but i also have a satellite dish so i you can watch some pretty strange news things the feeds on there,1,0
sw4718B-ms98-a,23,B,81.16275,85.02525,3.8625,that'd be a lot b- i- that's one thing i wish i had a little bit more of but,1,0
sw4718B-ms98-a,26,B,87.83275,92.71125,4.8785,i i don't know i'm kind of the type i just don't wanna work my whole life i'd rather be able to,1,0
sw4718B-ms98-a,27,B,92.71125,96.42475,3.7135,make my money and be able to retire and enjoy a lot of things before,1,0
sw4720A-ms98-a,15,A,41.296125,52.5255,11.229375,i don't know if i would rank that second but um since i have three boys uh it it can turn out to be important you know in a in a given year dental ca- dental expenses can really kill you,1,0
sw4720A-ms98-a,23,A,77.406625,86.341,8.934375,uh i guess that would be up there uh i'm not sure if i would rank uh how i would rank that next to say compared to retirement or uh,1,0
sw4720A-ms98-a,47,A,186.38825,188.490875,2.102625,there ought to be uh,1,0
sw4720A-ms98-a,48,A,188.490875,193.547,5.056125,uh some compromise that could where uh where the person would be guaranteed,1,0
sw4720B-ms98-a,59,B,286.419375,296.246625,9.82725,    you have to have an awful lot of fun just just getting there is has to be half the fun ,1,0
sw4721A-ms98-a,8,A,53.316625,64.3125,10.995875,um i felt really good i needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time now when i do those things they are boring i would rather be outside than in the gym doing this in one place,1,0
sw4721A-ms98-a,10,A,69.38225,75.88325,6.501,and i'm getting to be a good dancer from it and i'm just feeling really good i love the class it's real challenging,1,0
sw4721A-ms98-a,26,A,200.89225,205.564625,4.672375,yeah yeah i can see it'll be a good break right,1,0
sw4721B-ms98-a,4,B,10.32025,17.6185,7.29825,um these days i'd seems to be to easy to get busy with other things uh i have,1,0
sw4721B-ms98-a,29,B,114.7085,119.444,4.7355,do do you like to do it wi- with other people i mean like the the {jazzercise} would be,1,0
sw4723A-ms98-a,4,A,7.804875,18.76025,10.955375, and i love it and i would get another one in a minute unless i could afford what i really like which would be a red Ferrari or you know a little Corvette or something like that,1,0
sw4723A-ms98-a,19,A,124.3185,132.4905,8.172,yeah you know it's just necessary and i did i thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but  probably not practical,1,0
sw4723B-ms98-a,7,B,46.615875,55.679375,9.0635,and i suspect if i were to be able to get another car where object was um the best car i could get regardless of money  uh,1,0
sw4723B-ms98-a,8,B,55.679375,61.164625,5.48525,i probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari,1,0

sw4733A-ms98-a,27,A,146.561375,154.704125,8.14275,the teachers expect it Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system and if you read national surveys they're far from it,1,0
sw4733A-ms98-a,29,A,160.8295,174.051125,13.221625,well not very well they bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before tests i mean they make a big deal to me the paper should just be put on the desk that day and say just do this,1,0
sw4733A-ms98-a,39,A,231.30025,238.074,6.77375,and so i just find this a real problem i think if they're gonna be there all day they should find time,1,0
sw4733A-ms98-a,43,A,254.85925,257.86125,3.002,and they could be using this time better,1,0

sw4735A-ms98-a,3,A,11.239875,25.46675,14.226875,uh appropriate for a government to suggest that and say you know you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen or you know in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do,1,0
sw4735A-ms98-a,5,A,27.2065,42.16075,14.95425,i as far as a high school course i could see it as uh maybe a social uh sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program,1,0
sw4735A-ms98-a,7,A,53.29525,58.89425,5.599,i'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do,1,0

sw4735A-ms98-a,48,A,257.298625,271.09825,13.799625,um you you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever i would say the crimes would probably be you know if you went in for a certain crime there might be somebody that ha- has done a crime even worse than what you have so you're dealing with people ,2,0
sw4735A-ms98-a,49,A,271.09825,283.752,12.65375,um that may uh be an influence later on and uh an issue of anger would be is that i went to prison for a year or two but i didn't get any rehabilitation or um,2,0
sw4735B-ms98-a,11,B,58.315875,70.509625,12.19375,hum well that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it'd be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to uh mandatory,1,0
sw4735B-ms98-a,14,B,81.27625,92.4005,11.12425,you know it shouldn't be uh anything shouldn't be mandatory other than i guess like uh when you come to paying taxes or something like that,2,0
sw4735B-ms98-a,16,B,97.8715,103.555375,5.683875,uh people be more  to do it uh-huh yeah,1,0
sw4735B-ms98-a,27,B,205.967875,213.8365,7.868625,so they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas,1,0
sw4736A-ms98-a,9,A,54.26325,67.37875,13.1155,uh and i i think that uh that there there's something that has to be changed in the system to to do that i i think capital punishment uh uh laws are probably stringent enough but i think the appeal process is really getting in the way,1,0
sw4736A-ms98-a,10,A,67.37875,79.0655,11.68675,do do you feel as though there should be uh  more uh laws or or more uh you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by uh by uh uh capital punishment,2,0
sw4736A-ms98-a,15,A,120.266625,135.050125,14.7835,uh you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which uh  acts are done to uh to you know get somebody into a a situation where they're gonna be guilty of of a crime,1,0
sw4736A-ms98-a,17,A,147.214375,159.843625,12.62925,uh you know a a non a non critical e- error though be it not the right way to do it but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a law breaker is being supported,1,0
sw4736A-ms98-a,20,A,182.583625,190.288375,7.70475,uh and you know it didn't work but be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry,1,0
sw4736B-ms98-a,15,B,254.82475,262.858,8.03325,is to protect those who actually didn't commit the crimes all be it it seems that we are failing in that in that ultimate goal,1,0
sw4745A-ms98-a,2,A,4.51675,11.101125,6.584375, in fact uh i'll be leaving very shortly to go to work and i work different shifts so are pretty much a,1,0
sw4745A-ms98-a,5,A,35.69175,42.577,6.88525,in the business community or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family,1,0

sw4745B-ms98-a,8,B,82.443,94.494375,12.051375,and um i know that it it must be really challenging to um try to juggle a job and and also your children because i know my husband if i were gone as much as he is,1,0
sw4745B-ms98-a,11,B,104.591375,107.224625,2.63325,they don't like to be around adults,1,0

sw4746A-ms98-a,57,A,224.03975,230.1855,6.14575,but i don't know being up there if you'll see too much  they wouldn't be very practical except in the summer time ,1,0
sw4746B-ms98-a,90,B,279.90675,283.889625,3.982875,well hopefully we seem to be running on mild winters lately ,1,0
sw4749A-ms98-a,37,A,272.80325,279.409625,6.606375,well that's the other thing is a car needs to be able to handle the salt up here that they pour on the roads,1,0
sw4749A-ms98-a,38,A,279.409625,289.431625,10.022,and that's what kills cars up here is you know the salt rusts them out and then they die years before y- you know a car from California might be undrivable,1,0
sw4749B-ms98-a,36,B,184.414875,193.980375,9.5655, yeah well Chrysler is supposed to be when if you're looking at reliability Chrysler's supposed to be one of the best American cars right now,2,0
sw4752A-ms98-a,28,A,112.310125,126.807125,14.497, well i i think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands and you know th- then maybe those other people would be kind of scared and they would not do these bad things you know,1,0
sw4752B-ms98-a,3,B,6.295625,8.9955,2.699875,oh could could be,1,0
sw4752B-ms98-a,25,B,86.970875,101.744375,14.7735,that seemed to be what they were doing and it has and they've started stepped up more patrols in certain areas and it has has made some places safer but y- you know it's very difficult i mean if you don't have an infinite amount of money to to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could,1,0
sw4752B-ms98-a,30,B,125.97,131.122375,5.152375,yeah i think i think uh it's uh seems to be that,1,0
sw4752B-ms98-a,36,B,173.654125,178.25825,4.604125,some something has to be done because i definitely think it's it it really,1,0
sw4752B-ms98-a,41,B,206.693375,209.771625,3.07825,and something you know something has to be done but,1,0
sw4756A-ms98-a,3,A,18.9975,29.554125,10.556625,not a broad base of subjects but rather trying to concentrate them on particular subject areas that they think they might be interested in going into a career,1,0
sw4756A-ms98-a,25,A,213.952375,222.413375,8.461,i remember large group in certain uh courses mainly Political Science we'd have lectures where there'd be three hundred students,1,0

sw4758A-ms98-a,74,A,296.348125,299.618,3.269875, well i guess that will be it then  and,1,0
sw4759A-ms98-a,1,A,0,14.4895,14.4895,okay_1 uh we keep a monthly budget i just recently stopped working so i can be home with my kids  so we keep a a monthly budget and we try to stick to it  ,1,0
sw4759B-ms98-a,16,B,92.892,100.6545,7.7625,yeah  it uh it would be nice if we didn't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings,1,0
sw4759B-ms98-a,27,B,168.606375,179.100625,10.49425,uh chicken or whatever where if i did not work i'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot a lot uh better,1,0
sw4759B-ms98-a,37,B,227.164,235.47725,8.31325,but you know if they're gonna be in day care then they need to have some activities other than just being there,1,0
sw4759B-ms98-a,44,B,257.9955,266.608375,8.612875,although the insurance we had was good uh when Thomas was younger a lot of the stuff had to be paid up front,1,0
sw4765A-ms98-a,13,A,79.555875,85.335125,5.77925,and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems be meaningful,1,0
sw4765B-ms98-a,35,B,208.278,217.469,9.191,and clearly if you're into Coke and all you wanna do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap and you know you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it,1,0
sw4765B-ms98-a,47,B,267.673625,276.446375,8.77275,well yeah it goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people i mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen i don't think you can i mean,1,0
sw4769A-ms98-a,28,A,118.405875,120.695,2.289125,it'd be hard uh i don't know,1,0
sw4769B-ms98-a,4,B,12.398,16.574875,4.176875, i- i think politics you have to be real interested in power,1,0
sw4769B-ms98-a,20,B,81.083875,91.331875,10.248,uh it it it's absolutely irrelevant uh the only thing people should be talking about are what are your ideas uh for,1,0
sw4770A-ms98-a,1,A,0,8.60075,8.60075, uh i don't know my personal perception of government and uh the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted,1,0
sw4770A-ms98-a,2,A,8.60075,20.75075,12.15,and i don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to uh be self-serving to the community i think that they have their own uh wishes to uh be in the limelight,2,0
sw4770A-ms98-a,13,A,112.155625,122.816125,10.6605,and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpay- taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical uh,1,0
sw4770A-ms98-a,14,A,122.816125,132.384625,9.5685,i don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people you know what i'm saying it it's,1,0
sw4770A-ms98-a,17,A,147.150375,161.36075,14.210375,and it's kind of like we're the first to do it so i don't know if it's done because we're we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for uh,1,0
sw4770A-ms98-a,27,A,199.0595,212.1845,13.125,uh you can't expect uh when we have TVs and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for uh you know immorality and this and this and this that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be clean,1,0
sw4771A-ms98-a,24,A,186.425125,190.79975,4.374625,and there's really there's nowhere for this to be absorbed really,1,0
sw4771A-ms98-a,29,A,221.409875,227.3695,5.959625,yeah i you know Florida doesn't seem to be at least maybe Miami,1,0
sw4771A-ms98-a,40,A,294.16125,299.458,5.29675,be interesting to see when as Mexico develops industrially whether you know without,1,0
sw4771B-ms98-a,27,B,202.372625,209.3435,6.970875,uh you know of course then when when you're not recycling you've got these incendiary plants and stuff that can be some pretty disgusting stuff,1,0
sw4774A-ms98-a,7,A,29.859625,35.135375,5.27575,i guess i guess i'd have to go with uh i- i i'd be for it,1,0
sw4774A-ms98-a,10,A,42.523875,51.6695,9.145625,kind of a delicate subject i guess but i- i- i would i would probably go for for going ahead and doing it you know if it's got to be done for everyone,1,0
sw4774A-ms98-a,22,A,89.05375,99.729875,10.676125,you know but i guess if they you know you know there's uh i i guess there's some companies that aren't  that are doing it and it it seems to be working out so ,1,0
sw4774A-ms98-a,36,A,157.965125,172.148,14.182875,and then i kind of hear it goes into like uh this is just something i've heard that it kind of goes into like uh just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold that it kind of affects that too,1,0
sw4774B-ms98-a,12,B,51.24675,58.681625,7.434875,right i think if it's got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing it should be for everybody,3,0
sw4774B-ms98-a,41,B,245.297625,248.294,2.996375,because_1 i feel there'd be more trust in the employees,1,0
sw4774B-ms98-a,51,B,285.142625,292.028375,6.88575,well and eventually it's going to be not only the tea- you know the kids are going to be under scrutiny it's going to be the teachers,3,0
sw4784A-ms98-a,5,A,16.664,22.36425,5.70025,i'm not sure they know exactly what uh uh public education supposed to be for anymore,1,0
sw4784A-ms98-a,24,A,116.1925,127.375375,11.182875,people are um reluctant to pass uh school tax levies even uh when the money is needed or would be well spent because it's uh they don't have kids in the schools,1,0
sw4784A-ms98-a,35,A,187.264375,201.72125,14.456875,um  you know it barely made it i think it was added afterwards  i think the real the principal reason was uh education for civic participation the idea was that everybody should have an education so that they'd be a better voter,1,0
sw4784A-ms98-a,38,A,208.874375,223.227,14.352625,well that's exactly what i was going to say now there seem to be really three reasons for education one is education for civic duty one is education for economic reasons and one is education for civilization i mean and i- i think that one is,1,0
sw4784B-ms98-a,10,B,66.035375,76.39275,10.357375,so you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocket book for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of,1,0
sw4784B-ms98-a,16,B,144.89775,158.13475,13.237,right it troubles me too th- that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good and  by  for some of us at least the public good includes,1,0
sw4784B-ms98-a,18,B,171.785875,179.54325,7.757375,uh it means that you've got to be informed and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision,1,0
sw4784B-ms98-a,28,B,284.621,297.858,13.237,they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing and they are the three things that you mentioned but they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related like consumer e-,1,0
sw4785A-ms98-a,39,A,109.14325,113.4365,4.29325,and you just have to set the time and say okay this is gonna be it,1,0
sw4785B-ms98-a,22,B,86.67175,94.364625,7.692875,you know there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as i particularly like it but it's neat it's straight and i can live with it because i do stuff with my kids you know,1,0
sw4785B-ms98-a,32,B,137.7735,150.315375,12.541875,well i decided that you know you need that once in awhile that you you need to plan the quality time and and i do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty four hours a day,1,0
sw4785B-ms98-a,73,B,275.156125,282.336375,7.18025,i- i think that's true i can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment,1,0
sw4787A-ms98-a,5,A,4.541125,9.86075,5.319625, unfortunately  uh oh  this will be interesting ,1,0
sw4787A-ms98-a,18,A,64.427625,68.035,3.607375,everyone to be able to come at the same time,1,0
sw4787A-ms98-a,26,A,99.392875,102.242125,2.84925,yeah that would be so much harder,1,0
sw4787B-ms98-a,63,B,237.351875,244.688,7.336125,and inside that family there'll be the president an- or the chairman or whatever and then each person has an assignment to,1,0
sw4788A-ms98-a,14,A,108.36875,119.49175,11.123,we found this one area that doesn't have mosquitoes they just don't have them_1 and it's just wonderful not to be bugged all night long with a humming mosquito at your ear so,1,0
sw4788A-ms98-a,46,A,252.78425,263.659375,10.875125,you know you get a little bit fearful too uh you know things like that simply because it's they are supposed to be patrolled but uh you know it's it's a little bit different but,1,0
sw4788A-ms98-a,48,A,273.993,281.022625,7.029625,if you're gonna be gone all day long walking someplace or uh doing tourism or whatever uh,1,0
sw4788B-ms98-a,5,B,41.017125,47.90775,6.890625,would you then go -/hiking] hiking i mean would the camping be part of a long hike,1,0
sw4788B-ms98-a,23,B,139.735,148.53475,8.79975,a full tent it would be more a tarp uh strung up between trees and my dad would take uh,1,0
sw4788B-ms98-a,32,B,187.06525,194.592625,7.527375,i have an idea it's going to be um a lot more equipment and a lot more stuff ,1,0
sw4792A-ms98-a,12,A,22.69125,25.60925,2.918,well i definitely think like decisions have to be unanimous,1,0
sw4792A-ms98-a,29,A,71.32775,79.648375,8.320625,plus you know you may be you know doing a you know a a guilty verdict but it may not be you know may be for technical reasons ,3,0
sw4792A-ms98-a,35,A,101.116625,103.7905,2.673875,yeah it to be there'd be much more of that,2,0
sw4792B-ms98-a,11,B,39.53325,53.16775,13.6345,yeah that's yeah quorums are to easy to get and there's always that that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason you know so it's it's yeah definitely,1,0
sw4792B-ms98-a,12,B,53.16775,61.574125,8.406375,but um i don't know i- i could i couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing,1,0
sw4792B-ms98-a,14,B,62.655875,72.417875,9.762,yeah  tha- i- i know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that or arguing against that pretty vehemently but um,1,0
sw4796A-ms98-a,34,A,119.563375,134.106875,14.5435,uh respect that  you know there's endless amounts of research to be done endless amounts of resources and and what not it would be great if we could find some way to to uh use that to boost the economy,2,0
sw4796B-ms98-a,6,B,25.2005,35.645125,10.444625,uh i've al- i've always uh w- wanted very much uh to uh be somehow involved in all that,1,0
sw4796B-ms98-a,12,B,51.384375,54.338125,2.95375,unfortunately that can be done from the ground ,1,0
sw4796B-ms98-a,30,B,138.273875,151.716125,13.44225,i've always uh felt that uh uh one of the long term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up,1,0
sw4796B-ms98-a,33,B,170.96825,182.590625,11.622375,uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no  things that i think we should be doing,1,0
sw4796B-ms98-a,34,B,182.590625,193.6735,11.082875,so the side effects of doing that which i think would be good y- know very very good for all for everyone in the long run is uh is it some of the other things i'd like to see happen would happen also,1,0
sw4796B-ms98-a,43,B,233.817375,244.399,10.581625,the same money could probably be far better spent on uh uh lunar bases and solar power satellite research an- and uh and uh so forth ,1,0
sw4796B-ms98-a,44,B,244.399,250.010375,5.611375,it it would be do- it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor ,2,0
sw4798A-ms98-a,26,A,164.480375,177.8685,13.388125,and that's why you know like i say a part of my thing with the whole appeal process kind of bugs me because_1 here they have sat for you know fifteen years and i- i wonder about the families of the people who are the victims you know and they've got to be a little bit upset themselves and,1,0
sw4798A-ms98-a,35,A,211.883125,225.1435,13.260375,uh oh i for- i lost my point but yeah that's like i say i think the the victims and just if that's gonna happen they they just wanna have it done and over with but you know i agree there's got to be some appeal process because,1,0
sw4798B-ms98-a,38,B,195.865875,210.160875,14.295,death row but the other thing was whe- you know the family of the victims uh one of the fathers of the boys i think in California but you know wanted to be there to to witness it and it didn't feel like the whole thing was over and that's been fourteen years too i think  and uh,1,0
sw4799A-ms98-a,45,A,160.69,174.0785,13.3885,in the future you know she she knows it's not gonna be like that all the time and she's just wondering well what's gonna happen to me and and i you know it's i guess it's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that but,1,0
sw4799B-ms98-a,17,B,73.12425,84.33775,11.2135,my grandmother his his wife uh we also put her in a rest home she was in a rest home and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there,1,0
sw4801A-ms98-a,31,A,113.85025,126.53525,12.685,i wish if th- if they were gonna do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't be a little more you know not being able to put it off for fifteen years,2,0
sw4801A-ms98-a,56,A,234.32725,239.701875,5.374625,Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then,1,0
sw4801B-ms98-a,25,B,108.374375,113.237875,4.8635,and it's really you know it's it gets to be a a rea- a big problem,1,0
sw4801B-ms98-a,34,B,154.922875,165.445375,10.5225,oh sure you know i mean just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails um you know there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early,1,0
sw4802A-ms98-a,44,A,151.73475,157.787625,6.052875,do you have a favorite subject to read whether it be science fiction or or history or,1,0
sw4803A-ms98-a,2,A,0.779875,10.578,9.798125,okay uh basically i work for the government and our health insurance plan seems to be okay but it seems the benefits are are eroding and the cost of insurance goes up ,1,0
sw4803B-ms98-a,33,B,186.123625,198.3785,12.254875,through the government or have some sort of there can be competition as long as there is a universal plan i don't opp- i do not i'm not for eliminating all private health insurance whatsoever ,1,0
sw4804A-ms98-a,11,A,46.711625,49.31125,2.599625,that just kind of seems to be the way it works,1,0
sw4804B-ms98-a,26,B,117.97,121.454375,3.484375,uh i will be a week from next Monday,1,0
sw4804B-ms98-a,32,B,134.438875,140.612375,6.1735,and that'll probably it'll probably be that way till uh you know we like buy our own house together or something,1,0
sw4805A-ms98-a,7,A,18.776,27.049375,8.273375,penalty and trials and that kind of thing if it should be left up to the judge or trial by jury or to the people that kind of thing,1,0
sw4805A-ms98-a,12,A,52.504,57.47225,4.96825,like um should it be that way or should it be,2,0
sw4805A-ms98-a,30,A,144.343875,157.552625,13.20875,um -quires a little more research that kind of thing so that's why i say it probably mo- in most cases i would think it would co- the outcome would be better in most cases not always but uh,1,0
sw4805A-ms98-a,41,A,208.542625,219.23575,10.693125,yeah that's that's real scary you know i i i just think things are there's a lot of changes right now that are going on and it's getting to be where it's really it's just real scary,1,0
sw4805B-ms98-a,23,B,113.847375,120.7105,6.863125,what about the fact that uh a jury may be six people in some cases but um,1,0
sw4805B-ms98-a,42,B,190.32725,193.641375,3.314125,can't ev- you know be no jail time,1,0
sw4809A-ms98-a,14,A,47.18975,50.224375,3.034625, but it's been i think that may be the single,1,0
sw4809A-ms98-a,33,A,130.47725,137.481,7.00375,uh kind of expected i thi- i think it's difficult on my wife not to be um,1,0
sw4809A-ms98-a,42,A,202.067875,203.666375,1.5985,you have to be,1,0
sw4809A-ms98-a,43,A,203.666375,212.60525,8.938875,um i don't want to make it uh melodramatic but you have to be kind of cultural really if you want to put your family first and uh,1,0
sw4809B-ms98-a,32,B,160.151,172.106625,11.955625,looking for new value systems and having uh  a vision of the way the world was going to be when we were you know in middle age which i guess we are now,1,0
sw4811B-ms98-a,24,B,101.662875,112.85225,11.189375,so it's going to be really tough for me to do this so you know uh in in my very personal way i feel that insurance is just one of the most important benefits we have now,1,0
sw4811B-ms98-a,29,B,123.703375,128.138125,4.43475,so that will cease to be as important a benefit,1,0
sw4812A-ms98-a,21,A,80.489,83.65775,3.16875,and that's that's something to be aware of,1,0
sw4812B-ms98-a,12,B,69.465875,73.8855,4.419625,then there could be some sort of problem but uh i-,1,0
sw4814A-ms98-a,15,A,81.995625,90.810875,8.81525,i- it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that to make the decision on who would be the best to run um,1,0
sw4814A-ms98-a,29,A,148.562125,156.766375,8.20425,he might be a a one of those sure uh it it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer,1,0
sw4814A-ms98-a,32,A,179.32825,186.8035,7.47525,and you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way um,1,0
sw4815A-ms98-a,14,A,71.799375,80.539875,8.7405,i'll probably be faced with this you know sometime in the next few years as to what to do when mom gets to the point that she can't take care of herself,1,0
sw4815A-ms98-a,16,A,81.9885,90.931625,8.943125,unfortunately having her come live with us you know if she needs constant care is not going to be an option and what do you do you know,1,0
sw4815A-ms98-a,29,A,158.05125,165.556,7.50475,um and it might even be easier here in that there are so many more churches available more people to draw from,1,0
sw4815A-ms98-a,32,A,179.931125,192.95775,13.026625,but um uh you know other than care conditions you know i don't know really what else a person looks for uh convenience for the family would be a a wonderful thing,1,0
sw4815A-ms98-a,45,A,255.302125,265.916125,10.614,well and i think that would be a good idea too i don't know if these people need it for self-esteem it would seem to me that they would but if nothing else yes let them earn some of their money,1,0
sw4815B-ms98-a,7,B,47.93725,58.919,10.98175,and it makes the care very personalized of course but since it is a small community everybody knows everybody and so there there would be n- absolutely zero chance of any abuse,1,0
sw4815B-ms98-a,11,B,111.516875,117.827375,6.3105,uh it used to be that neighbors looked out for you the churches looked out for you but many of us don't belong to churches any more ,1,0
sw4815B-ms98-a,15,B,125.66625,133.426125,7.759875,no absolutely not you know i presume when when the time comes for something to happen to me that i will probably go back to Iowa to be in that community,1,0
sw4815B-ms98-a,32,B,244.502,255.827875,11.325875,so that they didn't have to be so expensive you know if y- if you've got somebody who is drawing welfare then perhaps that can be quote part of their their payment for their welfare payments,2,0
sw4815B-ms98-a,37,B,281.852,293.88675,12.03475,or does somebody in the family quit their job so that they can be at home a- and but of course that's not always wonderful either because somebody with Alzheimers needs twenty four hour watching and nobody can do that,1,0
sw4816B-ms98-a,8,B,97.51,104.9875,7.4775,i think that any money that is given must be given carefully just to something that is a proven point not just thrown at it,1,0
sw4816B-ms98-a,12,B,121.08775,127.543875,6.456125,and that people really didn't groups didn't wanna be associated with it because it was a morals issue,1,0
sw4816B-ms98-a,32,B,283.241125,294.26575,11.024625,and will take their beliefs into the workplace in and in this case a lot of people consider that to be standing in the way of science and medicine to try and solve this thing,1,0
sw4818A-ms98-a,17,A,95.774,102.255625,6.481625, so i think should i get another car uh much to my chagrin it'll have to be something more boxy,1,0
sw4818A-ms98-a,25,A,146.0835,158.004375,11.920875,yeah i think so it's you know Toyotas and all those they- they're nice cars but you know surely there's an American car i i'd love to check out the Saturn which is supposed to be a new newly made American car,1,0
sw4818A-ms98-a,52,A,274.262375,282.416875,8.1545,uh well i have been fortunate enough to be able to just pay for it and i i like to do that but there are people who can pay for it who prefer to finance it,1,0
sw4818A-ms98-a,53,A,282.416875,291.67775,9.260875,yeah i- it seems to me as you're paying interest you're bound to be end up paying more i guess now you have to think about uh if the money in the bank will get more interest,1,0
sw4818B-ms98-a,1,B,0,6.64325,6.64325, um well i'm just really excited about it because_1 i'm graduating from college next month and i hope to be buying a car sometime  in the future,1,0
sw4818B-ms98-a,51,B,205.514875,211.9985,6.483625,it's actually supposed to be really good the smaller ones i think around are eight thousand and then it gets up to maybe twelve thousand,1,0
sw4818B-ms98-a,54,B,215.44925,223.1885,7.73925,yeah yeah so i don't know maybe that's something to think about because_1 they're supposed to be completely made in the United States not one of these deals where,1,0
sw4818B-ms98-a,71,B,262.85375,269.497375,6.643625,um well i'm in ROTC so i'll be in the Army so on active duty so yeah,1,0
sw4821B-ms98-a,41,B,259.31875,269.612625,10.293875,so those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the TV set for awhile without interruption,1,0
sw4822A-ms98-a,31,A,176.28675,186.33825,10.0515,you know the earth and the different planets and things like that i i think it would be very interesting to do but whether it'd be feasible to do i don't know,2,0
sw4822A-ms98-a,49,A,270.020125,283.206,13.185875,and the people their moods are extreme you know it's like God if i don't get to see the sun i'm gonna be in this bad mood all this entire time i mean this is how i see people reacting you know when is the sun gonna come out,1,0
sw4822A-ms98-a,50,A,283.206,289.593375,6.387375,so i wonder how you know somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the ,1,0
sw4822B-ms98-a,3,B,11.08025,15.806625,4.726375,that's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels,2,0
sw4822B-ms98-a,4,B,15.806625,24.390625,8.584,um they're they're going to be doing a lot of interesting things um i think one of the the big things that he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads,1,0
sw4822B-ms98-a,14,B,188.063875,201.540375,13.4765,and as far as the practical aspects go i suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise between you know deep  i'm sorry deep space exploration and uh and not doing anything because ,1,0
sw4823A-ms98-a,1,A,0,7.8615,7.8615,i think that the middle east is of all the uh regions of the world the most volatile that we seem to be getting ourselves involved in,1,0
sw4823A-ms98-a,31,A,141.76725,151.860625,10.093375,uh i think that's up the stage for the end effect to for this uh uh revolution of Islamic fundamentalism what seems to be sweeping,1,0
sw4823B-ms98-a,5,B,31.816125,37.795,5.978875,we seem to be you know doing the same we've done in many other cases which is sticking our noses in where it doesn't belong,1,0
sw4823B-ms98-a,17,B,104.2355,110.0785,5.843,that you  didn't own in the first place there's you know going to be problems i mean that's basically what's happened i mean,1,0
sw4823B-ms98-a,20,B,119.71925,125.228375,5.509125,solution that's ever going to be workable you know i mean y- neither party was consulted  front,1,0

sw4837B-ms98-a,3,B,8.950875,15.051,6.100125,i guess i would say that one of the most um important changes seems to be,1,0
sw4837B-ms98-a,15,B,56.038375,68.1685,12.130125,it seems to me it seems to me like um like everyone is lamenting you know the loss of the nuclear family and saying that it's going to be the downfall of America but to me um,1,0
sw4837B-ms98-a,51,B,254.195625,262.054375,7.85875,that we might be good might be good for us to take into consideration is um in Israel they have this  you heard of that,2,0
sw4840A-ms98-a,11,A,21.680875,35.836875,14.156,but as far as writing checks out and paying taxes i think it's pretty high but i i'm uh you know i i guess that's where we have to be where it we have to keep raising them_1 for to keep some of the things that that we have and,1,0
sw4840A-ms98-a,13,A,41.168875,48.21675,7.047875,it's just scary though about you know how high are the taxes gonna be when my children are my age,1,0
sw4840A-ms98-a,26,A,104.58925,119.367875,14.778625,yeah and then you find out about all these things about are your taxes you know the taxpayers are your m- is your money going to where you want it to go and there's gonna be a special this week i i can't i can't remember if it's Twenty Twenty or one of those things where um ,1,0
sw4840A-ms98-a,29,A,133.958875,138.0375,4.078625,and uh so that would be interesting to see i wanted to see that program,1,0
sw4840A-ms98-a,57,A,246.719,253.593875,6.874875,what do you think about these items that are gonna be um taxed even more like um tobacco and that kind of thing,1,0
sw4840B-ms98-a,28,B,192.558,205.081,12.523,i mean it it can be argued one way or another whether the economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because tho- those countries tend to be um as far as cash flow a a lot,2,0
sw4840B-ms98-a,29,B,205.081,211.5915,6.5105,um have a be tend to have a much slower cash flow and don't try and generate a larger um,1,0
sw4843A-ms98-a,1,A,0,7.2175,7.2175,well my basic idea on dealing with the US budget as unrealistic and  as it may be,1,0
sw4843B-ms98-a,3,B,48.285125,53.13475,4.849625,well i have to i have to say that i would be very in favor,1,0
sw4843B-ms98-a,19,B,148.957875,158.16425,9.206375,uh for instance retirees they've started to up social security benefits it used to be so social security was just the final safety net,1,0
sw4843B-ms98-a,22,B,172.986625,180.72275,7.736125,i'm sorry i think that um all of the investment income regardless of how you invested should be taxable,1,0
sw4843B-ms98-a,25,B,200.710125,209.829375,9.11925,uh yeah i- i- i- i agree i think that social security ought to be done away with and put into the uh  tax,1,0
sw4845A-ms98-a,26,A,239.167875,249.75075,10.582875,so you get a lot of old people one old fellow had crates of beer he made friends with a barten- a bartender at some bar and he gets all the beer bottles because_1 the guy can't be bothered with it,1,0
sw4845B-ms98-a,38,B,231.511875,235.979625,4.46775,is that a city or state law that uh requires it to be recycled or,1,0
sw4846B-ms98-a,4,B,4.245875,14.955125,10.70925,most of my reading tends to be professional reading so  uh scanning headlines in the paper or reading over my wife's shoulder tends to be about the only newspaper stuff i do,2,0
sw4846B-ms98-a,13,B,70.473,82.746,12.273,and and that f- for me is as much a a a choice because i find it to be a good way to do it as it is a response to limited time for doing reading and stuff,1,0
sw4846B-ms98-a,28,B,217.450375,228.34025,10.889875,they've really been at the wrong time for me they seem to start very late for us and i got to be at work you know i'm leaving the house at like seven fifteen and so uh uh,1,0
sw4846B-ms98-a,29,B,228.34025,240.87975,12.5395,the some of them_1  seem to be you know like they don't come on until seven or something and and so there's not enough time an- uh to to watch it but they have so many other things that are thrown in,1,0
sw4846B-ms98-a,33,B,258.176,269.357,11.181,uh you know it's mostly just the timing they seem to be on so late in the morning that i- i started wondering to myself you know so who is it that watches these things but i think it's because of our particular time zone,1,0
sw4847A-ms98-a,54,A,252.775125,261.22025,8.445125,and i guess uh really you can get any any wood that's available but i'm thinking in terms of cost pine pine would probably be cheapest there,1,0
sw4847A-ms98-a,61,A,283.46475,294.134375,10.669625,and uh that had some work that had to be done with it some of the the door frames and things and uh i did a little bit of that and that was kind of interesting too kind of fun,1,0
sw4847B-ms98-a,42,B,219.507875,224.175375,4.6675,could be uh and seems like of uh stuff that people make with wood,1,0
sw4856A-ms98-a,23,A,112.53675,117.235875,4.699125,well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on but i i just feel that that,1,0
sw4856B-ms98-a,4,B,34.176125,42.07425,7.898125,um for i think it was a double murder uh to be honest i didn't pay that much attention uh to the details of it um,1,0
sw4856B-ms98-a,13,B,93.504,104.703875,11.199875,and then they have appeals well that's fine but it shouldn't take more than a few years i mean i should think two or three years maximum you should be able to know and you should be able to either put the guy to death,2,0
sw4856B-ms98-a,14,B,104.703875,111.795,7.091125,or he's innocent i mean it's if he's guilty for for you know multiple murders or whatever the case may be you know,1,0
sw4856B-ms98-a,28,B,187.249875,195.367625,8.11775,punishment in the United States is a lot weaker than it should be i mean it needs to be you know it's kind of like,2,0
sw4856B-ms98-a,38,B,261.531875,266.094375,4.5625,um y- you mean would he be put to death for that,1,0
sw4858A-ms98-a,32,A,136.752625,140.06,3.307375,otherwise there'd be uh they'd get you someplace else,1,0
sw4858B-ms98-a,31,B,254.133625,259.9025,5.768875,of course the Laotians and the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved but,1,0
sw4859A-ms98-a,30,A,199.524625,209.398375,9.87375,but but really the the the on the public TV you know McNeil Lehrer is one is an hours program that i always if if i watch any news program it'll be McNeil Lehrer,1,0
sw4859B-ms98-a,30,B,177.629375,186.1375,8.508125,which i've found to be a  a r- a very good quality um newspaper and i like a lot of the articles there th- the other thing when you said  we don't have cable TV,1,0
sw4859B-ms98-a,47,B,258.67025,264.379875,5.709625, -] which could be another  of Monty Python ,1,0
sw4861A-ms98-a,2,A,1.51,7.755,6.245,well i think AIDS research should be funded more than it's currently being funded i think that,1,0
sw4861A-ms98-a,15,A,119.09,127.667625,8.577625,but uh there's a lot of things that are funded and a lot of waste that can be redirected too  i think that that again that uh,1,0
sw4861A-ms98-a,16,A,127.667625,136.43875,8.771125,you know AIDS is is something that has to be dealt with by every person um and and not just in,1,0
sw4861B-ms98-a,10,B,33.61725,40.518625,6.901375,um certainly on an absolute scale it should be i- i think it should be funded more,2,0
sw4863A-ms98-a,21,A,221.278125,234.185375,12.90725,and it seems to be more of an expose than anything i mean you hearing ghastly stories about kids who are taking four and fi- like five years to graduate because when they try to sign up for a class they're so over crowded they can't get in the class,1,0
sw4863B-ms98-a,5,B,16.38225,31.306,14.92375,yeah i think here in Texas they're even running an ah a series right now on the news one of the news channels at night about they were like secretly um supervising people that were supposed to be working for a county here,1,0
sw4863B-ms98-a,15,B,102.735375,114.682375,11.947,yeah i think that we pay enough taxes and i think that if if everybody would be honest with how they dealt with the tax money if we could somehow get the same um ability to,1,0
sw4863B-ms98-a,16,B,114.682375,121.54075,6.858375,get work done and and be honest about it with our tax dollars i don't think they need to raise it and i think they'd be able to,2,0
sw4863B-ms98-a,38,B,289.7435,292.901375,3.157875, that could be i don't know um,1,0
sw4868B-ms98-a,42,B,249.118875,256.97475,7.855875,you need somebody to help you spend it i mean certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should be or not ,2,0
sw4869A-ms98-a,25,A,106.750125,112.247375,5.49725,you know that seems to be the target choice of the you know poor inter-city people,1,0
sw4869B-ms98-a,6,B,10.67025,16.12875,5.4585,i guess the first thing  you know comes to mind would be how they've changed to the worst,1,0
sw4869B-ms98-a,32,B,119.27125,122.452,3.18075,however on the brighter side cars seems to be ,1,0
sw4871A-ms98-a,6,A,37.275875,46.647,9.371125,w- with right wing regimes we kind of just winked at things like death squads and alike yeah we found Nicaragua to be the most horrible thing in the earth,1,0
sw4871A-ms98-a,19,A,170.626,178.48175,7.85575,down there and that seems to be well we'll give you aid but oh no not to feed your people no we want you to clean up,1,0
sw4871B-ms98-a,5,B,66.19675,80.9435,14.74675,or if it it doesn't even have to be commies if it's just a little left of uh of uh what the prevailing attitude is in the United States it was bad somehow and,1,0
sw4874A-ms98-a,31,A,240.75725,253.357875,12.600625,you know they're not sure who they want their leaders to be they're not sure how they want the you know uh relationships between the states to to shape so i agree with you know they're they need another couple years to to let them uh settle down,1,0
sw4874B-ms98-a,20,B,159.840375,171.038125,11.19775,type of uh introduction into the business world where beginning there'll be cheap labor and uh y- you know then we will have an i'd say thirty years if things stay the way things are now,1,0
sw4874B-ms98-a,21,B,171.038125,179.9725,8.934375,they could become another Korea or Malaysia or Thailand type of  source for cheap labor where American products could be built,1,0
sw4875A-ms98-a,16,A,60.983,67.519625,6.536625,but some of it's a little bit dirty you know you got all this machinery and stuff so you don't really want to be,1,0
sw4875A-ms98-a,46,A,167.2695,169.98425,2.71475,guess that can be pretty hot too,1,0
sw4875B-ms98-a,16,B,53.2595,56.199,2.9395,i guess that would be pretty casual,1,0
sw4876A-ms98-a,4,A,37.60575,48.391375,10.785625,and wh- why why would they be interested in y- in your little turnip unless you know one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest you know,1,0
sw4876B-ms98-a,46,B,275.886625,286.058375,10.17175,well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children i mean it has been a real um th- there have been some good  type experiences and i think,1,0
sw4877B-ms98-a,7,B,25.123125,27.80475,2.681625,well they're gonna be getting there  ,1,0
sw4877B-ms98-a,23,B,122.2015,128.080125,5.878625,i'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere but it's really it's really really very difficult and,1,0

sw4883A-ms98-a,12,A,94.9985,109.225875,14.227375,i there's a lot of rip-offs out there uh even in  parts of the retail uh community as far as uh you know they there seems to be this real lack of ability in dealing well with customer service ,1,0
sw4883A-ms98-a,13,A,109.225875,119.768125,10.54225,with and product support for a lot of these products i remembered when i you know certain product names where you'd get the product and immediately there's a problem with it and it needs to be upgraded and,1,0
sw4883A-ms98-a,41,A,286.991,295.7055,8.7145,oh they do that on VCR and it's high pressure i mean it's like well you know you must be stupid if you're not going to buy this   ,1,0
sw4886A-ms98-a,51,A,250.411625,256.716125,6.3045,i'd be surprised if it wasn't uh cheaper where you are well yeah it probably comes from where you are,1,0
sw4890A-ms98-a,5,A,33.631875,43.124,9.492125,that uh that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards so i- i really don't think it th- they can really do much of anything to change it what do you think,1,0
sw4890A-ms98-a,12,A,102.516,109.5675,7.0515,just like the burning and looting is self-destruct everybody says well this is the nineties and they're gonna rebuild and it'll be even better,1,0
sw4890A-ms98-a,14,A,115.320625,127.8865,12.565875,with everybody with that mindset they they're they're gonna that whole area is gonna be turned into residential ghetto you know and a- you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know,2,0
sw4890A-ms98-a,16,A,145.6155,150.582125,4.966625,well e- everybody's saying this is gonna be a new era we're gonna reexamine this thing ,1,0
sw4890B-ms98-a,5,B,42.744,49.323875,6.579875,um i i don't think so possibly in the jury selection would be the only,1,0
sw4895A-ms98-a,11,A,84.981875,95.53375,10.551875,they get corrupted by it basically by losing touch with the people that they're supposed to be serving and i think they forget who it is they're supposed to be representing,2,0
sw4895A-ms98-a,28,A,241.246125,251.772875,10.52675,yeah well in some cases they do they vote their conscience and then of course you know they may be punished for not doing the appropriate thing that that came down with the cable issue,1,0
sw4895A-ms98-a,35,A,290.48675,298.817875,8.331125,yeah you have to be a real old timer and powerful to be able to do that especially when it's committee assignment handout time and,2,0
sw4895B-ms98-a,9,B,101.976875,112.998625,11.02175,an experience that i had with politics at a lower level uh and i think what it boils down to is that if you can't find compromise that you're not going to be successful ,1,0
sw4895B-ms98-a,14,B,138.376,151.730125,13.354125,don't misunderstand me now but it it all came down to the fact that you had to be able to deal i mean we had uh our board our officers and our b- board of directors of about twenty people now this is a good size group of people to manage,1,0
sw4895B-ms98-a,21,B,183.492125,194.53375,11.041625,and i think what you have to do i mean y- i think it's important that you have an agenda but you also have to be able to to compromise on it because if the majority are against you ,1,0
sw4895B-ms98-a,32,B,278.992125,291.48425,12.492125,and you know there's probably about ten percent or maybe less than that five percent of the people who can vote their own conscience and still be successful but all the rest fall by the wayside,1,0
sw4899A-ms98-a,2,A,7.372125,21.283875,13.91175,i kind of feel that there are more important issues to be dealt with than worrying about the metric system and i think the reason it failed last time is that most people really just didn't see any real benefit in changing,1,0
sw4899B-ms98-a,14,B,103.49425,111.6875,8.19325,most scientific formulas can be adapted with the metric system because of the way things are interrelated that you'll need those extra conversion constants,1,0
sw4899B-ms98-a,34,B,240.1685,252.795625,12.627125,so uh we'll just used to keep using the standard size but we'll just call it something else so you have odd things like sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter where originated in the metric system it'll probably be something regular but i guess that's that's not too ,1,0
sw4901A-ms98-a,11,A,73.028875,76.839875,3.811,i might be mistaken but that's what sounds familiar to me,1,0
sw4901A-ms98-a,27,A,169.84525,179.48375,9.6385,so if i could be sure that the people who are sentenced to execution absolutely did it because you know during the with the jury system you're not quite sure,1,0
sw4901A-ms98-a,29,A,188.16075,195.202375,7.041625,but i- i think the reason we don't go for it is because we're afraid that we might be making a mistake and you can't fix it,1,0
sw4901B-ms98-a,7,B,27.886875,35.077375,7.1905,um personally i kept i keep thinking that if i could be guaranteed that,1,0
sw4901B-ms98-a,8,B,35.077375,48.24,13.162625,the people who perpetrate some of these vicious crimes were never allowed free then i would not be in favor of capital punishment,1,0
sw4901B-ms98-a,11,B,52.10175,60.7925,8.69075,uh they could be paroled and go right back to doing what they did before i i feel decidedly un- uneasy about it,1,0
sw4901B-ms98-a,70,B,265.251625,279.165,13.913375,but i do  i feel decidedly uneasy about the judicial system in our country now not only because we can't be sure that the jury,1,0
sw4902A-ms98-a,22,A,100.052625,106.727125,6.6745,one is at the high end uh they always wanna be able to um do some brain draining,1,0
sw4902A-ms98-a,23,A,106.727125,120.309125,13.582,they'd always like to be able to attract the uh Einsteins or the Professor Chou or you know they'd like to be able to get the top people in any field and so they can almost always find room for someone like that,2,0
sw4902A-ms98-a,31,A,153.697875,160.458875,6.761,they cannot close off the Mexican border not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be uh,1,0
sw4902A-ms98-a,50,A,257.291875,264.127,6.835125,so there's uh uh there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in,1,0
sw4902B-ms98-a,8,B,19.634,24.62225,4.98825,uh i there just is not gonna be room for all of us we don't have jobs now,1,0
sw4903A-ms98-a,59,A,270.965375,276.991875,6.0265,provoke anger in the Soviet Union and and what would those what would those steps be,1,0
sw4903B-ms98-a,15,B,92.49725,99.998625,7.501375,all of that is going to have to happen and if any one of them turn sour they could still be uh dangerous simply because they might not,1,0
sw4903B-ms98-a,20,B,156.490375,164.144625,7.65425,as well as in Russia uh those in Russia may be some of them in areas that uh may have uh,1,0
sw4905A-ms98-a,7,A,13.37425,23.13375,9.7595,i think one of the um my first of all always salary and second the second thing is um because we have children so it'd be um,1,0
sw4905B-ms98-a,29,B,182.11275,186.64325,4.5305,yeah and being on a you know rigid schedule wouldn't there wouldn't be anyway to do that at all,1,0
sw4905B-ms98-a,30,B,186.64325,201.394875,14.751625,and i think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too because_1 i mean usually you know you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless it's summer time you know and even if it's summer sometimes you get home so late that there's you know you can't do anything with them_1,1,0
sw4908A-ms98-a,11,A,98.98,108.3185,9.3385,you know they got i mean there there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you can you could use for landfill now   ,1,0
sw4908A-ms98-a,24,A,234.471875,248.999375,14.5275,i- i think it should be i- it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy y- y- everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away you know uh but more than that every week uh you've got to pay by the pound,1,0
sw4908A-ms98-a,25,A,248.999375,256.390625,7.39125,i- i- i- i think i think people would be would get very very you know they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff,2,0
sw4908B-ms98-a,34,B,255.815375,265.92675,10.111375, the only alternative i would see is uh and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain,2,0
sw4909A-ms98-a,11,A,26.666375,34.98025,8.313875,what i see behind it this this this uh maybe it's always true of third party movements but this one seems to be almost entirely negative,1,0
sw4909A-ms98-a,17,A,74.778625,81.292,6.513375,and since most people agree on what needs to be done but nobody can figure out how to do it he's just going to say uh,1,0
sw4909A-ms98-a,19,A,85.150375,91.979125,6.82875,which is uh pretty attractive and when uh Congress can't seem to be able to get anything done,1,0
sw4909A-ms98-a,27,A,133.732,147.949125,14.217125,it's it's a reaction to what's what's happened over the last ten or fifteen years where um the parties really just seem to be intent on blocking the other party from getting any further the the uh,1,0
sw4909B-ms98-a,10,B,54.734875,65.993,11.258125,necessarily new ideas and you know this is my positive outlook but rather uh saying well uh i'm just not very happy with uh with the other two parties seem to be going type of thing,1,0
sw4909B-ms98-a,16,B,90.98575,105.485375,14.499625,yeah i guess read a political cartoon uh must be probably about a week ago now or maybe you saw it i don't know how widespread this was but it showed uh Perot like revealing his,1,0
sw4909B-ms98-a,32,B,230.23425,242.49625,12.262,in each party and not really coming up with a new ideas or the or maybe i mean it it you know it's time for maybe a definite new vision and and what's going on which may be you know a blend of both,1,0
sw4911A-ms98-a,12,A,83.76325,94.6065,10.84325,um there are certain jobs in which i'd be more likely to feel comfortable about it and and those are the jobs in which a person's performance could affect your life,1,0
sw4911A-ms98-a,18,A,112.67075,126.201,13.53025,and where your actions could affect somebody's life i'd be much more accepting of drug testing but under no circumstances would i think that you could just go take a job and they could say hey guess what you know we're  do this,1,0
sw4911A-ms98-a,19,A,126.201,130.433375,4.232375,i- i think it has to be up front and then you've got the choice of not doing it,1,0
sw4911A-ms98-a,21,A,160.041875,165.909875,5.868,well yeah i imagine it would be just this is new company policy and we're doing it to ,1,0
sw4911A-ms98-a,27,A,199.048375,209.704,10.655625,well you know i'm home a little too often i think  they're not calling substitutes that often but at any rate um i had taken a state test to be of all things a court officer ,1,0
sw4911A-ms98-a,28,A,209.704,221.69875,11.99475,uh my mom had worked for the state and she thought this was a brilliant idea so i just went along with it i thought it'd be neat you know like a James Bond woman with a gun and all this and part of the um you know you take this test i did very well and they called me in for a physical,1,0
sw4911A-ms98-a,37,A,275.48575,283.80625,8.3205,uh-huh yeah you know i mean i guess if there i guess there is something to be worried about if there's a whole science of knowing how to deal with the ,1,0
sw4911B-ms98-a,6,B,10.332875,21.13975,10.806875,that i think it should be like a normal practice all the time i think there are certain circumstances where it's important but it it kind of touches on on on privacy,1,0
sw4911B-ms98-a,11,B,48.356,53.35475,4.99875,and some jobs uh uh require you to be,1,0
sw4911B-ms98-a,33,B,150.253625,162.246,11.992375,if you know  i- i am sure this could happen you know if you're gonna if you're gonna um test us you should be testing the old people too and so they get into a to a discrimination problem probably or something like that,1,0
sw4914A-ms98-a,25,A,150.496125,157.827,7.330875,  here's what we have now i mean what's in five years from now it's just unimaginable what we're going to be able to do with these things,1,0
sw4914A-ms98-a,36,A,208.02725,217.723375,9.696125,it was something that could be easily learned for everyone but now we have the things like the Mac and Windows and other things where all you got to do is point at something and push a button,1,0
sw4914A-ms98-a,37,A,217.723375,229.950625,12.22725,and i think that the technology's catching up to the point where we're going to be able to do things and make it a lot easier t- for people to understand how to do these things,1,0
sw4914A-ms98-a,38,A,229.950625,236.9805,7.029875,so i'm hoping that we will see another type of revolution but one that will be a little more friendly to the end user,1,0
sw4914B-ms98-a,5,B,18.185,20.978,2.793,and i'd be dead without it ,1,0
sw4914B-ms98-a,43,B,157.03325,163.59125,6.558,yeah yeah well you know if we ever get any sort of uh ISDN running nationally it'll be really incredible,1,0
sw4917B-ms98-a,2,B,1.087625,12.5435,11.455875,yes the uh type of cars that i was uh uh i would probably be most interested in if i was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a uh Mazda Miata,2,0
sw4917B-ms98-a,55,B,251.764625,257.37275,5.608125,mainly because_1 everyone makes them_1   you can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be ,1,0
sw4917B-ms98-a,66,B,289.04225,299.522,10.47975,yeah there there's some other cars i'd like but i uh uh i would never be willing to spend quite that much money for uh like uh uh i'll drool over ,1,0
sw4925A-ms98-a,16,A,69.515125,75.71975,6.204625,i mean it's got to be humiliating to have a stranger a nurse or somebody lift you in and out of a bathtub,1,0
sw4925A-ms98-a,21,A,118.258625,125.223,6.964375,well i- i think nowadays people are making that effort to eat right and to be more fit and i think old age is getting older,1,0
sw4925B-ms98-a,67,B,190.93275,192.709125,1.776375,oh that'd be awful,1,0
sw4925B-ms98-a,91,B,261.8635,265.0025,3.139,if they were uh you know seemed to be,1,0
sw4926A-ms98-a,18,A,165.6215,179.188625,13.567125, it- it's going to be interesting to see if he uh actually you know we hear the complaints about uh voter apathy and and the whole the whole shebang about throw the bums out,1,0
sw4926A-ms98-a,20,A,188.234,196.7945,8.5605,and uh you have to wonder whether is this going to be something that uh is really going to result in,1,0
sw4926A-ms98-a,21,A,196.7945,207.591125,10.796625,um a mass turnout of the current people that we have in there or whether this is just going to be another of the same old well throw the bums out but not my bum you know ,1,0
sw4926A-ms98-a,26,A,248.050375,261.933875,13.8835,ag- against Bush more or less in half you know i mean you're dividing it too far and then he squeaks by for four more years and you know for me that's not a going to be a wonderful uh feeling,1,0
sw4926A-ms98-a,28,A,263.974625,274.161625,10.187,i think it'll be interesting to see um whether it turns out he gets more than twenty percent of the vote if that um i,1,0
sw4926A-ms98-a,30,A,294.261875,299.714,5.452125,yeah but i you know it'll be interesting i i don't i agree that i don't think that,1,0
sw4926B-ms98-a,6,B,39.1945,51.686875,12.492375,as a- as popular as he seems to be and i mean it seems to be um doesn't really matter who who it is it's just that fact that he's not in either party,2,0
sw4926B-ms98-a,7,B,51.686875,55.683625,3.99675,that uh seems to be why he's so popular i guess,1,0
sw4926B-ms98-a,18,B,117.920125,123.397125,5.477,it seems to be i don't know it's kind of like um people always,1,0
sw4926B-ms98-a,20,B,131.9975,140.29,8.2925,people always  say how how can these politicians be in power and stuff but i guess they forget that they're the ones who put them there in the first place you know,1,0
sw4926B-ms98-a,23,B,151.56775,160.15075,8.583,but you know all they have to do is vote him out of office you know it's almost like they want to be forced to vote the way that they,1,0
sw4927A-ms98-a,18,A,100.63925,108.17075,7.5315,when do they assume this is gonna be proposed or mandatory or when when i what what year are they looking at,1,0
