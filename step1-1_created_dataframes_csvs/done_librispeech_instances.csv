1695-142312-0083,0083,she was not particularly annoyed at margaret's way of behaving she did not care enough for her for that she had taken missus thornton's remonstrance to the full as keenly to heart as that lady expected and margaret's passion at once mollified her visitor far more than any silence or reserve could have done,1.0
1695-142312-0087,0087,she at any rate was fulfilling her determined purpose he was trying to understand where he stood what damage the strike had done him a good deal of his capital was locked up in new and expensive machinery,1.0
1696-142314-0006,0006,without his taking any trouble about it said mister hale i don't believe they would it's the bustle and the struggle they like as for sitting still and learning from the past or shaping out the future by faithful work done in a prophetic spirit,1.0
1696-142314-0051,0051,i don't believe a cousin of yours could exaggerate is miss hale so remarkable for truth said mister thornton bitterly the moment he had done so he could have bitten his tongue out what was he,1.0
1696-142314-0054,0054,who had been acquainted with him for many years and then to speak to margaret as he had done she did not get up and leave the room as she had done in former days when his abruptness or his temper had annoyed her she sat quite still,2.0
1696-142314-0057,0057,as if she quivered in some unwonted chill he felt as the mother would have done in the midst of her rocking it and rating it had she been called away before her slow confiding smile implying perfect trust in mother's love had proved the renewing of its love,1.0
1696-142314-0118,0118,the workman was not to be found after the day's work was done he had gone away to some lecture or some club or some beer shop according to his degree of character mister hale thought of trying to deliver a course of lectures at some of the institutions,1.0
1704-142310-0033,0033,it's the only way working men can get their rights by all joining together more the members more chance for each one separate man having justice done him government takes care o fools and madmen,1.0
1705-142318-0053,0053,i have been so much obliged to you for all you have done about frederick i am only sorry it has been so unsuccessful replied he with a quick glance towards mister bell as if reconnoitring how much he might say before him,1.0
1705-142318-0102,0102,such a change from helstone it is years since i have been at helstone but i'll answer for it it is standing there yet every stick and every stone as it has done for the last century while milton i go there every four or five years,1.0
1710-133294-0050,0050,this is done without difficulty as the territory of a hunting nation is ill defined it is the common property of the tribe and belongs to no one in particular,1.0
1714-142291-0041,0041,it's not that we want their brass so much this time as we've done many a time afore we'n getten money laid by and we're resolved to stand and fall together,1.0
1714-142291-0079,0079,now i must go you have done me good bessy i done you good yes i came here very sad and rather too apt to think my own cause for grief was the only one in the world,2.0
1715-142315-0063,0063,and an interval of so much change overpowered him more than any roughness or expression of disapproval could have done i'm afraid we've done too much said mister bell you're suffering now from having lived so long in that milton air,2.0
1715-142315-0068,0068,even if i could have foreseen that cruellest martyrdom of suffering through the sufferings of one whom i loved i would have done just the same as far as that step of openly leaving the church went,1.0
1715-142315-0099,0099,one of his chums told me as much and he was only kept back by her want of fortune now that will be done away with how asked mister thornton too earnestly curious to be aware of the impertinence of his question,1.0
1717-142305-0003,0003,come miss hale come my dear you must not give way or where shall we all be there is not another person in the house fit to give a direction of any kind and there is so much to be done,1.0
1717-142305-0014,0014,of melancholy business towards evening dixon said to her i've done it miss i was really afraid for master that he'd have a stroke with grief he's been all this day with poor missus and when i've listened at the door i've heard him talking to her,1.0
1717-142305-0027,0027,and it has done master good and if we're to keep master frederick in hiding he would have to go poor fellow before mister bell came,1.0
1717-142305-0037,0037,he took frederick's hand in both of his my boy you must go it is very bad but i see you must you have done all you could you have been a comfort to her,1.0
1721-142317-0011,0011,there will have to be a sale so select what things you wish reserved or you can send a list afterwards now two things more and i have done you know or if you don't your poor father did,1.0
1721-142317-0027,0027,and margaret closed her eyes by way of stopping the conversation the house teemed with comfort now compared to what it had done the evenings were chilly and by missus shaw's directions fires were lighted in every bedroom,1.0
1721-142317-0049,0049,at some possible time in some possible place and bid her tell her father how much she wished if he could manage it that he should come to see her when he had done his work in the evening,1.0
1721-142317-0054,0054,now to missus thornton's thought she to herself it must be done,1.0
1723-141149-0014,0014,as people do when feeding chickens i walked with the old man and this demonstration of friendship was repeated several times it was concluded by three hard slaps which were given me on the breast and back at the same time he then bared his bosom for me to return the compliment which being done,1.0
1724-395-0032,0032,i omit here all actions which are already recognized as inconsistent with duty although they may be useful for this or that purpose for with these the question whether they are done from duty cannot arise at all,1.0
1724-395-0034,0034,for in this case we can readily distinguish whether the action which agrees with duty is done from duty or from a selfish view,1.0
1724-395-0036,0036,it is out of the question in this case to suppose that he might besides have a direct inclination in favour of the buyers so that as it were from love he should give no advantage to one over another accordingly the action was done neither from duty,1.0
1724-395-0058,0058,and not of tender sympathy and it is this love alone which can be commanded the second proposition is that an action done from duty derives its moral worth not from the purpose which is to be attained by it,1.0
1724-395-0062,0062,formal principle of volition when an action is done from duty in which case every material principle has been withdrawn from it the third proposition which is a consequence of the two preceding i would express thus,1.0
1724-395-0066,0066,simply the law of itself which can be an object of respect and hence a command now an action done from duty must wholly exclude the influence of inclination and with it every object of the will,1.0
173-200-0025,0025,everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal,1.0
1731-142320-0076,0076,he might be shot all this flashed through my mind and i said it was not me i was not at the railway station that night i knew nothing about it i had no conscience or thought but to save frederick i say it was right i should have done the same,1.0
1731-142320-0077,0077,you forgot yourself in thought for another i hope i should have done the same no you would not it was wrong disobedient faithless at that very time fred was safely out of england,1.0
1731-142320-0085,0085,there are many things more unlikely i should say replied mister bell but i believe i never shall still somehow one does not like to have sunk so low in in a friend's opinion as i have done in his,1.0
1731-142320-0092,0092,but we will not talk of that any more if you please it is done my sin is sinned i have now to put it behind me and be truthful for evermore if i can very well if you like to be uncomfortable and morbid be so,1.0
1733-139046-0055,0055,then they return to the market place and dress after which they undergo the pepper ordeal pepper is dropped into the eyes of each of them and while this is being done the sufferer has to make a confession of all his sins to answer all questions,1.0
1733-139046-0068,0068,which he goes to and shuts the door when he has done he knocks and comes out so that none ever see the king eat or drink for it is believed that if any one should the king shall immediately die,1.0
1733-139046-0106,0106,will himself partake of that food because if he did so he would on the principles of sympathetic magic suffer equally with his enemy from any injury done to the refuse,1.0
1734-142311-0024,0024,with captain and mister lennox with frederick the thought of the last knowing what she had done even in his own behalf was the most painful for the brother and sister were in the first flush of their mutual regard and love,1.0
1734-142311-0060,0060,the sameness of their toil deadens their imagination they don't care to meet to talk over thoughts and speculations even of the weakest wildest kind after their work is done they go home brutishly tired poor creatures,1.0
1736-142281-0019,0019,shall we have lunch before or after we have looked at the houses we marked in the milton times oh let us get our work done first very well,1.0
1736-152007-0030,0030,she spoke in the lowest tone as he had done but with distinct decision we shall not be together we shall have parted the blood rushed to stephen's face we shall not he said i'll die first,1.0
1736-152007-0035,0035,no it is not done said maggie too much is done more than we can ever remove the trace of but i will go no farther don't try to prevail with me again i couldn't choose yesterday what was he to do he dared not go near her,2.0
1736-152007-0051,0051,that the opposite feeling would never have grown in me as it has done,1.0
1736-152007-0052,0052,i should have prayed for help so earnestly i should have rushed away as we rush from hideous danger i feel no excuse for myself none i should never have failed toward lucy and philip as i have done if i had not been weak selfish and hard,1.0
1736-152007-0070,0070,it is too late to say what we might have done or what we ought to have done admitting the very worst view of what has been done it is a fact we must act on now our position is altered the right course is no longer what it was before,3.0
1737-142396-0009,0009,he neither laughed nor sneered as the olympians would have done but possessed of a serious idiosyncrasy he would contribute such lots of valuable suggestion,1.0
1737-142397-0002,0002,some one of us had had presents and pretty conventional speeches and had glowed with that sense of heroism which is no less sweet that nothing has been done to deserve it but the holiday was for all the rapture of awakening nature for all,1.0
1737-142397-0025,0025,so we sheered off together arm in arm so to speak and with fullest confidence i took the jigging thwartwise course my chainless pilot laid for me a whimsical comrade i found him ere he had done with me,1.0
1737-142397-0036,0036,jubilant as ever her song went bubbling on and death in life and again life in death were its alternate burdens and looking round and seeing the sheep nibbled heels of turnips that dotted the ground their hearts eaten out of them in frost bound days now over and done,1.0
1737-148989-0040,0040,as he remembered what it had done since a certain little white hand had laid in it confidingly i'll make em proud of me yet and no one shall ever know of this awful year i can wipe it out and i will so help me god,1.0
174-168635-0018,0018,he had returned to prison this time for having done right he had quaffed fresh bitterness disgust and lassitude were overpowering him even the memory of the bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant but after all that sacred memory was growing dim,1.0
1743-142912-0010,0010,scrapper flew back and perched on a dead branch of one of the trees where he received the congratulations of all his feathered neighbors he took them quite modestly assuring them that he had done nothing,1.0
1746-143015-0107,0107,but little could be done to collect the scattered camp when the morning broke the cabin of stumpy nearest the river bank was gone higher up the gulch they found the body of its unlucky owner but the pride the hope the joy,1.0
1748-1562-0046,0046,only as soon as they have done they burst into peals of tiny laughter as if it was such a joke to have been serious over anything these i speak of however are the fairies of the garden,1.0
1748-1562-0069,0069,now she is done that was the duty now for the fun and with a wild laugh they sprang away most of them towards the cottage during the latter part of the song talk they had formed themselves into a funeral procession two of them bearing poor primrose,1.0
175-123036-0012,0012,we'll show them how we can get over the ground if we only know why it is always difficult to drive fast in the city in the middle of the day when the streets are full of traffic but we did what could be done and when a good driver,1.0
175-123036-0020,0020,the young man put his head out and said anxiously i think i had better get out and walk i shall never get there if this goes on i'll do all that can be done sir said jerry i think we shall be in time,1.0
1750-135624-0022,0022,i know these things have been done i know they are done every day,2.0
1750-135624-0032,0032,i regretted the necessity but it must be done he was open to conviction he saw that the rules of the service were imperative he fled i married her here's the coach that's her head,1.0
1750-135624-0040,0040,done said mister pickwick what should be done,2.0
1750-142369-0034,0034,and think there's nobody but me knows about this and i'll take care of you as if i was your brother you're the same as ever to me for i don't believe you've done any wrong knowingly hetty had laid her hand on the letter but adam did not loose it till he had done speaking,2.0
1752-16632-0030,0030,nonsense i know better it is all foolishness this craze for giving most things are better destroyed as soon as you are done with them why nobody wants such truck as this,1.0
1754-137004-0029,0029,looked back angrily and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison one seemed to hear left left left well done lads said prince bagration,1.0
1756-134819-0010,0010,done nothing none of the actions of his conscience had been decisive he was more than ever as he had been at the first moment,1.0
1756-134819-0046,0046,that could be done with the spokes not with the hub and the felly is in a bad state too is there any one in this village who lets out teams no is there another wheelwright the stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert with a toss of the head no,1.0
1756-134819-0050,0050,and was manifesting himself he said himself that he had done all he could and that now he had nothing to do but retrace his steps quietly if his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the inn,1.0
1757-128127-0107,0107,for which mister walter crane has done the beautiful and suggestive design of the young knight the best way to make children good is to make them happy and happiness seems to me an essential part of lady meath's admirable scheme,1.0
176-122025-0024,0024,he was looking very hard at toad as he said this and could not help thinking he perceived something vaguely resembling a twinkle in that animal's still sorrowful eye there's only one thing more to be done continued the gratified badger toad,1.0
1760-143006-0060,0060,squirming and wriggling upon the nail like a worm upon the hook well said saunders you've done it now i'll leave you to examine it don't go in heaven's name cover it up man cover it up shove a cloth over it here,1.0
1760-143006-0093,0093,what have i done asked eustace why does it come after me i'm no worse than other men i'm no worse than you saunders you know i'm not it was you who were at the bottom of that dirty business in san diego and that was fifteen years ago,1.0
1765-143010-0034,0034,spirits it's something much more terrible he allowed his head to sink heavily on his chest if i did not positively know that i had never done her any harm i should suppose myself to be suffering from guilt from remorse,1.0
1765-143010-0049,0049,and these unrealized perceptions of me he interpreted as i had known that he would as his soul's inevitable penance he had come to believe that he had done evil in silently loving theresa all these years,1.0
1765-143010-0070,0070,for a little they walked about together speaking of common daily things then suddenly theresa burst out i am going away allan i have stayed to do everything that needed to be done now your mother will be here to care for you and it is time for me to go,1.0
1765-143010-0073,0073,sit here he said and drew her down beside him on a bench and tell me what it means why you are going is it because of something that i have been have done she hesitated,1.0
1765-143010-0079,0079,she gave a cry and then thing of silly cruel impulses that i was i saw what i had done the very thing that i wished to avert i had precipitated for allan in his sudden terror and pity had bent and caught her in his arms for the first time they were together,1.0
1769-143484-0004,0004,i see him satisfying the calls of hunger under the first oak and those of thirst at the first rivulet i see him laying himself down to sleep at the foot of the same tree that afforded him his meal and behold this done all his wants are completely supplied,1.0
177-122839-0002,0002,and there was the rapture and wretchedness of choosing fashions and being fitted anne and diana spent half their time at echo lodge and there were nights when anne could not sleep for wondering whether she had done right in advising miss lavendar to select brown rather than navy blue for her traveling dress,1.0
177-122839-0007,0007,ain't mister irving splendid he just worships the ground she treads on and it makes me feel so queer sometimes to see the look in his eyes when he's watching her it beggars description miss shirley ma'am i'm awful thankful they're so fond of each other it's the best way when all's said and done,1.0
177-55218-0009,0009,so you see she finished when alice greggory had done laughing over the tale,1.0
1772-135621-0056,0056,disappeared with the candle in her hand down the kitchen stairs perfectly satisfied that she had done everything that could possibly be required,1.0
1772-135621-0090,0090,and a two pronged fork and very little was done in this way very little of the beef was done either and the ham which was also from the german sausage shop round the corner was in a similar predicament,2.0
1780-143478-0073,0073,and for the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid poor winterbourne was fairly bewildered no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements,1.0
1784-142294-0013,0013,he recalled all that had seemed so clear not half an hour before as it came out of mister thornton's lips and then he made an unsatisfactory compromise his wife and daughter had not only done quite right in this instance,1.0
1784-142294-0014,0014,but he did not see for a moment how they could have done otherwise nevertheless as a general rule it was very true what mister thornton said that as the strike if prolonged must end in the masters bringing hands from a distance,1.0
1784-142294-0016,0016,but as to this boucher he would go and see him the first thing in the morning and try and find out what could be done for him mister hale went the next morning as he proposed he did not find boucher at home but he had a long talk with his wife,1.0
1784-142294-0067,0067,no allusion was made to the strike then pending she did not yet know how coolly such things were taken by the masters as having only one possible end to be sure the men were cutting their own throats as they had done many a time before,1.0
1784-142294-0087,0087,she heard mister thornton say that has been done then came a hurried murmur in which two or three joined all those arrangements have been made some doubts were implied some difficulties named by mister slickson,1.0
1789-137618-0012,0012,remember what i have done for the country of cornwall and in what jeopardy i have been in for the weal of you all for when i fought for the truage of cornwall with sir marhaus the good knight i was promised for to be better rewarded,1.0
1789-137618-0055,0055,so would i do for i had liefer strife and debate fell in king mark's court rather than arthur's court for the honour of both courts be not alike as to that said sir tristram i know well but that that was done it was for despite of me,1.0
1795-142410-0015,0015,what would the romans have done supposing hannibal had cried history has not even considered the possibility rules and precedents should be strictly observed on both sides when they are violated the other party is justified in feeling injured,1.0
1795-142410-0027,0027,i suggested timidly feeling that something had to be done to relieve the tension and cut more new bows and arrows she gave me a knife my last birthday said edward moodily never budging it wasn't much of a knife but i wish i hadn't lost it,1.0
1795-142412-0002,0002,he knew he was a brute the moment he had done it selina had not meant to worry only to comfort and assist but his soul was one raw sore within him,1.0
1795-142412-0007,0007,she didn't even want him to say he was sorry if he would only make it up she would have done the apologising part herself but that was not a boy's way something solid harold felt was due from him and until that was achieved,1.0
1795-142412-0033,0033,a black sun and a reeling sky he had forgotten the tea things it was useless it was hopeless all was over and nothing could now be done nevertheless he turned and ran back wildly blindly,1.0
1800-142858-0028,0028,both of which should be done every day and every corner carefully swept in order to keep the stable sweet and clean the real duties of the groom follow where the horses are not taken out for early exercise,1.0
1800-142858-0051,0051,with reasonable exercise will not be thrown away after this operation on reaching home very hot the groom should walk him about for a few minutes this done he should take off the moisture with the scraper,1.0
1800-142858-0062,0062,and either a wooden horse or saddle trees for the saddles and pads all these parts should be dry clean and shining this is only to be done by careful cleaning and polishing,1.0
1800-142858-0080,0080,this is done by first well slushing it with clean water so as to wash away all particles of sand having first closed the sashes to avoid wetting the linings,1.0
1804-131525-0039,0039,both from within and without when i have done all i can to render vice as uninviting to him as it is abominable in its own nature i myself have had indeed but few incentives to what the world calls vice,1.0
1804-131525-0043,0043,but indeed you are not and if you persist in the attempt believe me you will bitterly repent it when the mischief is done i am to send him to school i suppose to learn to despise his mother's authority and affection,1.0
1804-131527-0021,0021,but if done by the same hand as the others it was evidently some years before for there was far more careful minuteness of detail and less of that freshness of colouring and freedom of handling that delighted and surprised me in them,1.0
1806-143946-0022,0022,the enterprise and energy of a people who have done so much in other places have done little here the whole of that wilderness in which the latter incidents of the legend occurred is nearly a wilderness still,2.0
1806-2536-0004,0004,an indispensable requisite in history and travels destroys the charm of fiction for all that is necessary to be conveyed to the mind by the latter had better be done,1.0
1806-2536-0040,0040,he is quite aware of its numerous faults some of which he has endeavored to repair in this edition but as he has in intention at least done his full share,1.0
1809-143025-0008,0008,at other times setting it up on her desk she made a pincushion of its patient and inoffensive body whether this was done in revenge of what she considered a second figurative obtrusion of clytie's excellences upon her,1.0
1809-143025-0029,0029,and partly that he never really believed he was going to do anything before it was done he did not like to think of mliss it was a selfish instinct perhaps which made him try to fancy his feeling for the child was foolish romantic and unpractical he even tried to imagine,1.0
1813-142304-0094,0094,it would even have affected herself and rendered her incapable of talking at all but fred true to his theory did something perpetually and talking was the only thing to be done besides eating at breakfast before the night of that day,1.0
1819-144401-0004,0004,something must be done about it said the french doll as she stamped her little foot if i catch the culprit i will well i don't know what i will do with him said the tin soldier,1.0
1819-144402-0020,0020,yes tell us where you have been and what you have done raggedy all the dolls cried but raggedy ann just then noticed that one of the penny dolls had a hand missing,1.0

3923-174992-0005,0005,many things are no doubt permissible under the law which if done would show the doer of them to be the enemy of his species and this destruction of foxes in a hunting country may be named as one of them the duke might have his foxes destroyed if he pleased,1.0

6506-73020-0003,0003,and said something as to a private little dinner for two thereby apologizing for proposing to the count to dine without other guests pateroff accepted the invitation and harry never having done such a thing before ordered his dinner with much nervousness,1.0
6509-67147-0022,0022,it was n't done in england what do you do if you can't keep awake i asked you slip out quietly go to your room ask a maid to call you after you have had forty winks,1.0

6510-62516-0026,0026,no captain replied the boy we shall know to morrow said the engineer till then there is nothing to be done yes replied pencroft what fire said the sailor who also had a fixed idea,1.0
6510-62516-0027,0027,to the summit to morrow and then we shall see if this land is an island or a continent till then i repeat there is nothing to be done yes fire said the obstinate sailor again,1.0
6510-62516-0060,0060,half an hour later they arrived at the river pencroft soon made a raft of wood as he had done before though if there was no fire it would be a useless task and the raft following the current they returned towards the chimneys,1.0
6512-67886-0000,0000,nevertheless the jacobites did not despair one of the most zealous among them a gentleman named bulkeley who had formerly been on terms of intimacy with godolphin undertook to see what could be done,1.0
6512-67886-0038,0038,if such were the royal pleasure he would undertake that the thing should be done but on the whole he thought that it would be better to wait till the next session of parliament and then he hinted at a plan which he afterwards more fully matured,1.0
6512-67886-0043,0043,he was laughing at them the loss of half a guinea would have done more to spoil his appetite and to disturb his slumbers than all the terrors of an evil conscience what his offers really proved was that his former crime had sprung,1.0
6513-71946-0025,0025,he and his men would probably have been butchered and in judging him it is only fair to take this into account what he should perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method on the other hand this,1.0
6518-66470-0004,0004,but there is always something to be done and no heart left to do it to and fro the dull thought surges as the driven waves fight in gulfy channels oh victorious one give strength to rise go out and meet thee in the night,1.0
6519-69411-0032,0032,and afterwards taken such advantage of by herself and others a pebble had done it all a pebble placed in the gateway by bela's hands as she described this and insisted upon the fact in face of the judge's almost frenzied disclaimer,1.0
652-130726-0028,0028,when done take the meat out of the sauce,1.0
6529-62554-0001,0001,or some other material of the same nature that the water of the channel had been raised like a dome the bottom of the brig crushed in and she had sunk instantly the damage done to her hull,1.0
6529-62554-0041,0041,believe me pencroft replied the engineer it would be better not to have to make the experiment well said the sailor what ought to be done with regard to those six villains who are roaming about the island,1.0
6529-62554-0049,0049,they are six and well armed if they each lay hid in a corner and each fired at one of us they would soon be masters of the colony why have they not done so said herbert no doubt because it was not their interest to do it besides we are six also,1.0
6529-62556-0024,0024,since it has been found by experience that contact with the air is dangerous during the first days gideon spilett and cyrus harding reasoned thus with their simple good sense and they acted as the best surgeon would have done,1.0
6533-399-0026,0026,but for beings that are in addition affected as we are by springs of a different kind namely sensibility and in whose case that is not always done which reason alone would do for these that necessity is expressed only as an ought and the subjective necessity is different from the objective,1.0
6533-399-0027,0027,and as if we could not prove its reality and objective necessity independently in that case we should still have gained something considerable by at least determining the true principle more exactly than had previously been done but as regards its validity and the practical necessity of subjecting oneself to it,1.0
6533-399-0091,0091,even as necessary which can only be done by disregarding all desires and sensible inclinations the causality of such actions lies in him as an intelligence and in the laws of effects and actions which depend on the principles of an intelligible world,1.0
6534-64469-0006,0006,declaring that he had done all that a man could do,1.0
6534-64470-0017,0017,at least a portion of it true listen cried the other suddenly and tell me what you would have done mister sutton was taken and was banished and came back again as any worthy priest would do then he was taken again and condemned,1.0
6534-64470-0022,0022,i sent the messenger away again and said that i would listen to no such tales and mister sutton died like a good priest three days after repenting i doubt not bitterly of the weakness into which he had fallen now sir what would you have done in my place,1.0
6538-81858-0017,0017,they also talked much of the battle many of them were yet under the influence of hysterical excitement they told extraordinary stories of the things they had seen and done and they believed all they told were true,1.0
6539-66420-0029,0029,i wanted so much that everything should be done by you alone without anybody's help or interference she said and after she had spoken there followed a silence once or twice she looked towards the wall and each time she saw the space of golden light narrowed,1.0
6540-232291-0031,0031,doubtless it might be procured at the inn yonder near the racecourse and thither she began to move her thoughts were more at rest she had made her plan for the evening all that had to be done was to kill time for another hour or so,1.0
6540-232291-0050,0050,and really after all i am so glad was her conclusion i didn't think she had really gone all the afternoon i've been expecting to see her back again but she won't come now and it is a good thing to have done with the wretched business,1.0
6540-62512-0004,0004,do you despair of ever seeing him again god forbid replied the sailor their work was soon done and pencroft declared himself very well satisfied now said he our friends can come back when they like they will find a good enough shelter,1.0
6540-62512-0021,0021,although he was not a man to trouble himself about a small or great grievance at any rate there was only one thing to be done,1.0
6540-62512-0028,0028,and the tears which he could not restrain told too clearly that he had lost all hope the reporter recounted all that they had done in their attempt to recover cyrus harding,1.0
6540-62512-0044,0044,the sailor first made sure that it was quite dry that done we must have some paper said he here replied spilett after some hesitation tearing a leaf out of his note book pencroft took the piece of paper which the reporter held out to him,1.0
6540-62512-0055,0055,he was roaming about the shore he was like a body without a soul pencroft knew fifty ways of cooking eggs but this time he had no choice and was obliged to content himself with roasting them under the hot cinders in a few minutes the cooking was done,1.0
6544-71420-0012,0012,he said pleasantly i was afraid your running away would hurt you i i must thank you for what you have done for me mister styles she answered oh that's all right miss margaret i'd do as much for you any day i think it's a bloomin shame the way you have been treated,1.0
6544-71420-0018,0018,i'll see to it that you escape that you are never bothered any more how can you do that never mind how it can be done promise to give up case and be my wife and i will attend to all of the rest and i'll promise you more than that listen,1.0
6548-96095-0041,0041,it occurred to me at once that some one might have gone through it but no woman could have done it,1.0
6549-71114-0045,0045,miss mayfield my god what have i done and with an awful cry between a shriek and a groan the wretched man cast himself upon the ground by the side of the fallen body the storm was beating wildly,1.0
6549-71115-0030,0030,beyond human help eh what nace no no no no it can't be said the old man kneeling down and bending over him in helpless trouble attend doctor grimshaw while i hurry out and see what can be done mary,1.0
6550-53343-0051,0051,it was the spot where his father and mother had been buried i have done for i fear that my reader is growing weary but i could not refrain from drawing the picture of this worthy brother of the angle who has made me more than ever in love with the theory,1.0
6550-65820-0006,0006,and i listen for the sound of my footsteps as i have done at midnight to the ticking of the death watch encouraging a kind of fanciful superstition every object carried me back to past times,1.0
6553-86683-0008,0008,he caused there a hillock round and green to be dug out of the middle and the hole thus made to be covered carefully over so that a little company could dwell there together this was done deirdre and her foster mother dwelt in the bothy,1.0
6553-86683-0015,0015,the bird asked to get inside for the sake of the god of the elements and you yourself tell me that anything that is asked in his name we ought to do if you will not allow the bird that is being benumbed with cold and done to death with hunger to be let in,1.0
6553-86683-0073,0073,to go home to our father and tell the deeds of heroism we have done than accept anything on these terms from you,1.0
6553-86683-0088,0088,and i have done what you desired me,1.0
6553-86683-0093,0093,but stronger is sorrow's self connachar the people then gathered round the heroes bodies and asked connachar what was to be done with the bodies the order that he gave was that they should dig a pit and put the three brothers in it side by side,1.0
6553-86683-0096,0096,and the two shoots united in a knot above the loch the king ordered the shoots to be cut down and this was done twice until at the third time the wife whom the king had married caused him to stop this work of evil,1.0
6557-65546-0001,0001,mary margaret laughed and switched her long thick braid of black hair from one shoulder to the other no fear of my being lonesome mother campbell i'll be just as careful as can be and there are so many things to be done,1.0
6568-69911-0028,0028,i know said bert me and edna we done things like that flowers and all that seems years off now she was beautiful and daring and shy,1.0
6568-69911-0031,0031,oh it's all foolishness and haste and violence and cruel folly stupidity and blundering hate and selfish ambition all the things that men have done all the things they will ever do gott smallways,1.0
6574-120583-0019,0019,no such crime has ever been committed and it is not for us to judge nor for any small council we shall deliver this creature to the world council itself and let their will be done we looked upon them and we pleaded our brothers,1.0
6574-120583-0020,0020,you are right let the will of the council be done upon our body we do not care but the light what will you do with the light,1.0
6574-120583-0023,0023,we answered what is not done collectively cannot be good,1.0
6583-48224-0001,0001,i regret i cannot make so decent an end as was done with sir richard varney and bill sykes he deserves however as severe a fate as either of those heroes with the former we will not attempt to compare him,1.0
6583-48224-0053,0053,or to ems or the richer tables of homburg how he flourished for a while with ambiguous success how he talked to the young english tourists of what he had done when in parliament especially for the rights of married women,1.0
6583-48224-0068,0068,but we all drawl through it at a snail's pace we are supposed to tear ourselves from our friends but tearing is a process which should be done quickly what is so wretched as lingering over a last kiss,1.0
6583-66269-0019,0019,her clenched hands opened the lids fell down over her bright eyes her breast heaved no more as it had done and presently she fell asleep,1.0
6590-64282-0027,0027,but alas even then he thought more of the wrong he had done to himself as a gentleman than of the grievous wound he had given his wife's heart,1.0
6590-64285-0016,0016,there was so much to be done for hesper's wardrobe that for some days mary found it impossible to go and see letty her mistress seemed harder to please than usual and more doubtful of humor than ever before this may have arisen but i doubt it,1.0
6590-64285-0031,0031,she knew mary's freedom of speech upon occasion but felt that to draw back would be to yield the point what have i done to be ashamed of pray some ladies are ready to plume themselves upon not having been guilty of certain great crimes,1.0
6590-64285-0035,0035,not one of which you have ever done really mary this is intolerable cried hesper i am only doing what you asked me ma'am said mary and i have said nothing that every one about mister redmain does not know as well as i do,1.0
6590-64285-0044,0044,not to mention that i oughtn't and couldn't and wouldn't do them for any man many a woman said mary with a solemnity in her tone which she did not intend to appear there has done many more trying things for persons of whom she knew nothing i dare say,1.0
6594-68897-0042,0042,there was something almost pathetic in the readiness with which this was done by young girls who were longing to fit themselves for teachers but had not the means many a girl at lowell was working to send her brother to college who had far more talent and character than he,1.0
6610-34596-0034,0034,it is done said the doctor and from out all their mouths vaguely stammered in every language came the dismal utterances of the catacombs,1.0
6610-65818-0015,0015,private charity has also no doubt done much to alleviate the misery which obtrudes itself at every turn still public spirit appears to me to be hardly alive here,1.0
6610-70916-0012,0012,half an hour afterward a lone figure ascended the steep road which led to the house a woman fearless of the night because life had already done its worst to her,1.0
6610-70916-0055,0055,that done she stood there staring at herself in the mirror and living over remorselessly the one day that like a lightning stroke had blasted her life her veil slipped unheeded from her dresser to the floor,1.0
6614-67847-0008,0008,they'se done somethin to my missy decided estralla they'se scairt her she ran down the path toward the wall at the end of the garden and stopped suddenly for right in front of her caught on the jessamine vine which grew over the wall,1.0
6614-67847-0010,0010,decided estralla and in an instant she was going up the wall in a much easier manner than had been possible for sylvia she dropped on the further side just as sylvia had done and traced sylvia's steps to near the landing place,1.0
6625-39674-0017,0017,i mean to say they must be brought to the point where they cannot tell the heavens from the earth for i shall to morrow contend with the king and when i fight i mean to conquer please to understand it shall be done monsieur give me your other ideas that is your business,1.0
6627-67844-0026,0026,demanded grace before sylvia could reply sylvia has not said or done anything to make you talk to her this way and grace linked her arm in sylvia's and stood facing the other girls well grace waite you can associate with yankees if you wish to,1.0
663-128990-0000,0000,when this had been done they felt safe and began to act as if they had been a menagerie of wild beasts let loose upon a body of defenceless men women and children not only did these wretched men rush into the houses stealing everything valuable they could find and were able to carry away,1.0
663-128990-0002,0002,and therefore could give no information to their brutal inquisitors and others died without telling what they had done with their valuables when the town had been thoroughly searched and sifted the pirates sent men out,1.0
663-128990-0015,0015,and the pirates promised that if this were done they would depart and molest the town no more the money was paid the cattle were put on board the ships and to the unspeakable relief of the citizens,1.0
663-128991-0027,0027,and the only thing left to be done was to decide what particular place they should favor with a visit there were some who advised an attack upon havana giving as a reason that in that city there were a great many nuns monks and priests,1.0
6636-72296-0104,0104,somehow it never occurred to me till i heard your story that possibly the skeleton in the chalk pit might be that of the poaching tinker i will now most assuredly have it buried in the churchyard that certainly ought to be done said i,1.0
6637-69607-0027,0027,what else did you expect me to do cried sir wilfrid i seem indeed to have jolly well wasted my time oh no you were very kind and i dare say you might have done some good,1.0
6637-69607-0062,0062,i meant to have done all your commissions but i was persuaded by evelyn to spend a couple of hours with her and her maid undertook them lady henry flushed deeply so,1.0
6637-71405-0008,0008,why are you all staring at me in this manner what have i done where am i have i been sick margaret raymond came closer and took her hand margaret she stared at him and flung his hand away,1.0
6641-64718-0002,0002,he sent for them to his cabinet and after conversing with them kindly he added you must be sensible my dear children that my great age prevents me from attending so closely as i have hitherto done,1.0
6641-64718-0090,0090,then you will have done me a service i shall never be able sufficiently to repay the prince's eyes filled with tears as she spoke yet he considered himself obliged to undertake the dreadful task,1.0
6641-64718-0091,0091,and the cat continuing to press him with greater eagerness with a trembling hand he drew his sword cut off her head and tail and threw them into the fire no sooner was this done than the most,1.0
6641-64718-0111,0111,to which there were twenty flights of stairs and a door to each of which my father kept the key so that none came near me without his consent when the fairies heard of what had been done,1.0
6652-70974-0026,0026,the sheriff had told him to take forcible possession of the house but this might only be done now after a sanguinary encounter for warrenton the squire of gamewell's man was there and had eyed him malevolently,1.0
6652-70974-0049,0049,and now he could notch warrenton's shaft at one hundred paces a feat difficult in the extreme the old retainer took huge delight in training the lad i do hear of a brave business in archery to be done in sherwood forest he said,1.0
6652-70975-0005,0005,without waiting an answer he stepped back and withdrew his bow pass then locksley and good fortune attend you he went on we may meet again ere the day be done but it is not sure you will not try for the purse will,1.0
6652-70975-0035,0035,as it was all the jousting was done and most of the nobles had already gone away the sheriff was fussily preparing himself to escort the prince to the castle when the horns blew announcing the arrival of the lincolnshire bowmen they had pushed their way clumsily through the array of tents and now,1.0
